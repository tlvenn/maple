/**
 * TanStack DB adapter for unitflow — Maple addition, not part of upstream.
 *
 * Bridges TanStack DB collections (framework-agnostic `@tanstack/db` layer)
 * into unitflow Stores: a collection becomes a read-only
 * `Store<CollectionState<T>>` whose subscription lives exactly as long as the
 * enclosing model instance (or registry) scope. Snapshots are pushed on every
 * data change AND every status transition — the status listener is what keeps
 * an empty collection from being stuck on `loading` forever (an empty sync
 * emits no change events, only `loading → ready`).
 *
 * Mutations need no adapter: `Mutation.make` accepts any Effect handler, so a
 * model wraps its write (e.g. `@maple/effect-db`'s `optimisticAction`)
 * directly.
