/**
 * A declarative one-shot side effect returned from a reducer's `update`: an
 * Effect that resolves to the follow-up message fed back through `dispatch`.
 * The reducer runtime runs it (forked into the model instance's scope) and
 * re-dispatches its result, so every asynchronous transition still flows
 * through the pure `update`. This is foldkit's `Command`, expressed with
 * unitflow's Event/Store primitives — the reducer never leaves the state
 * machine to do async work.
 *
 * `execute` may not fail (`E = never`): in this discipline a model's failures
 * are messages. Turn a fallible effect into both-outcomes-as-messages with
 * `Effect.match`/`Effect.catch*` before wrapping it as a command.
