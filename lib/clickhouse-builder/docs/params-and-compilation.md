# Params and compilation

## Declaring params

```ts
CH.param.string("orgId")
CH.param.int("limit")
CH.param.dateTime("startTime")
```

Those three are the whole set. A param is an `Expr` placeholder usable anywhere an expression
is — most often on the right of a comparison:

```ts
.where(($) => [$.OrgId.eq(CH.param.string("orgId"))])
```

Calling a comparison method **on** an unresolved param (rather than passing it as an argument)
throws `QueryBuilderError` with code `UnresolvedParam`, since there is nothing to compare yet.

## How params are resolved

> **Params are resolved at compile time, not execution time.** `compile` substitutes each
> value into the SQL text. This is _not_ server-side parameter binding — ClickHouse never sees
> a placeholder.

```ts
const compiled = CH.compile(query, { orgId: "org_123" })
compiled.sql // … WHERE OrgId = 'org_123'
```

Two consequences worth planning around:

- **Every distinct parameter set produces a distinct SQL string.** If you cache or fingerprint
  by SQL text, each value is its own entry.
- **Escaping is the safety mechanism**, not binding. String values go through
  `escapeClickHouseString`, which escapes backslashes and single quotes:

    ```ts
    CH.compile(query, { orgId: "a'b\\c" })
    // … WHERE OrgId = 'a\'b\\c'
    ```

    Values flowing through `param.*` and the comparison methods are escaped. Values you splice
    in via [`rawExpr` / `rawCond`](./extending.md#raw-escape-hatches) are **not** — never build
    those from user input.

A query is a reusable template: compile the same one repeatedly with different params.

## `compile`

```ts
CH.compile(query, params, options?)
```

| Argument             | Meaning                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `query`              | The `CHQuery` to compile                                         |
| `params`             | Record resolving every `param.*` placeholder by name             |
| `options.rowSchema`  | Effect `Schema` used by `decodeRows` / `decodeFirstRow`          |
| `options.skipFormat` | Omit a trailing `FORMAT` clause (used internally for subqueries) |

`compile` and `compileCH` are the same function. Unions use `compileUnion(union, params)`.

## The `CompiledQuery`

```ts
interface CompiledQuery<Output> {
	readonly sql: string
	readonly tenantScope: "org" | "cross-org"
	readonly rowSchemaDeclared: boolean
	readonly routing?: "ingest"
	readonly decodeRows: (rows) => Effect<ReadonlyArray<Output>, CompiledQueryDecodeError>
	readonly decodeFirstRow: (rows) => Effect<Option<Output>, CompiledQueryDecodeError>
}
```

| Field                           | Purpose                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sql`                           | The statement to execute. The builder never runs it.                                         |
| `tenantScope`                   | Whether the query pins a single tenant — see [Tenant scoping](./tenant-scoping.md)           |
| `rowSchemaDeclared`             | Whether a `rowSchema` was supplied, so a caller can tell real validation from a pass-through |
| `routing`                       | Set by `.routing("ingest")`; metadata for your executor                                      |
| `decodeRows` / `decodeFirstRow` | See [Decoding results](./decoding-results.md)                                                |

There is deliberately **no `castRows`**. A bare cast looked type-safe while hiding wire-format
drift, so it was removed in favour of schema-checked decoding.

## Handwritten SQL

When you need SQL the builder cannot express, `unsafeCompiledQuery` wraps a string in the same
`CompiledQuery` interface so downstream code is uniform. `tenantScope` is required there,
because it cannot be inferred from a string. See [Extending the DSL](./extending.md).

## Errors

`QueryBuilderError` is thrown synchronously during compilation, with a `code`:

| Code                 | Cause                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SelectRequired`     | Compiling a query with no `select()`                         |
| `UnresolvedParam`    | Comparing on a param before compilation resolved it          |
| `InvalidOrderBySpec` | An `orderBy` entry that is not a `[column, direction]` tuple |

It is an Effect `Schema.TaggedErrorClass`, catchable by the tag
`"@maple-dev/clickhouse-builder/QueryBuilderError"`.
