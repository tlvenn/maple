## Anti-Patterns Verdict

**LLM assessment**: Not AI-generated-looking. No side-stripes, gradient text, glassmorphism, ghost-cards, oversized radii, or eyebrow scaffolding. Component vocabulary is the house system used consistently. One borderline: staggered entrance animation on the integrations catalog grid (`integration-catalog.tsx:194-208, 271-279`) — decorative motion on a settings surface (mitigated: 6px rise, 0.32s, respects `useReducedMotion`). P3.

**Deterministic scan**: `detect.mjs` over all 8 changed files — **0 findings, exit 0**. Full agreement with the LLM assessment; no false positives to adjudicate. (The stagger animation is outside the detector's rule set — an LLM-only catch.)

**Visual overlays**: skipped — headless preview browser only; no user-visible tab for injection. Fallback: CLI detector + live screenshots/DOM inspection.

## Overall Impression

This is confident, house-consistent product UI that a Grafana/Datadog-fluent user would trust: the CF card's `display: contents` analytics grid and the honest STATUS_UNAVAILABLE handling are genuinely above-average craft. The gap is consequence management: the three worst findings are all "high-stakes action, zero guardrail" (disconnect, variable deletion, silent edit discard). The single biggest opportunity is wrapping destructive/irreversible moments in proportionate friction.

## What's Working

1. **Failure-state honesty** — `STATUS_UNAVAILABLE` distinct from `NOT_CONNECTED` (`integration-catalog.tsx:106-109`; guarded CTA `cloudflare-account-card.tsx:313-332`) prevents the classic "fetch error looks disconnected → user re-runs OAuth" trap.
2. **Shared analytics grid via `display: contents`** (`cloudflare-account-card.tsx:117-141, 395`) — zone/worker rows scan like a table without table chrome; dense readout on identical column tracks.
3. **Grafana-compatible mental model end-to-end** — `var-` URL params (`$dashboardId.tsx:32-43`), URL → default → All → first-option resolution (`dashboard-variables-context.tsx:124-149`), URL-pinned values stay selectable when absent from options (`variable-selects.tsx:95-98`).

## Priority Issues

1. **[P1] Disconnect has no confirmation** (`cloudflare-account-card.tsx:291-302, 498-501`)
    - Why: one misclick (8px from "Reconnect") destroys an account-level OAuth connection feeding 27 zones + Workers ingestion; success is just a toast.
    - Fix: AlertDialog stating consequences ("Stops collecting traffic analytics for N zones and Workers") with a destructive-styled confirm.
    - Suggested command: `$impeccable harden`
2. **[P1] Long variable names break the toolbar chip** (`variable-selects.tsx:121`)
    - Why: label span lacks `truncate`/`min-w-0`; verified live (scrollWidth 326 vs clientWidth 254) — value and chevron clipped invisible.
    - Fix: `truncate` on label, `shrink-0` protection for value + chevron.
    - Suggested command: `$impeccable polish`
3. **[P1] Deleting a widget-referenced variable is silent** (`variables-manager-dialog.tsx:178-183` + save path)
    - Why: widgets interpolating `$name` silently break or mis-query after save.
    - Fix: diff removed names against widget params on save; warn "2 widgets reference $service".
    - Suggested command: `$impeccable harden`
4. **[P2] Validation error on pristine draft** (`variables-manager-dialog.tsx:94-99` with auto-created empty draft at `:152-155`)
    - Why: the first frame of the feature is an error state — scolds before the user acts.
    - Fix: suppress "Name is required" until touched or Save attempted.
    - Suggested command: `$impeccable polish`
5. **[P2] Quiet-zone expanded list repeats "no data in last 24h" ×28 in amber**
    - Why: amber signals "attention needed" for parked domains that will never have data; pure noise after the group header already said it.
    - Fix: drop per-row detail inside the expanded quiet group; neutral dot; reserve amber for enabled-but-silent collectors.
    - Suggested command: `$impeccable distill`

## Persona Red Flags

**Alex (Power User)**: No keyboard path into the variables manager (only the `+` chip / overflow menu in edit mode). Comma-split custom options (`variables-manager-dialog.tsx:410-419`) make comma-containing values impossible and normalize spacing while typing. No duplicate-variable action.

**Sam (Accessibility)**: "Hide zones with no data" toggle measured **2.83:1** at 11px (`text-muted-foreground/70`, `cloudflare-account-card.tsx:451`) — interactive control failing WCAG badly. `muted-foreground` body text measured 4.38:1 (systemic token, just under AA). Status dots convey health by color alone with detail only in native `title` tooltips (not keyboard-accessible). No live region announcing variable selection changes. Catalog cards do have proper `focus-visible` rings.

**Riley (Stress Tester)**: 0-option custom variable saves fine → permanent "—" chip with "No matching values." and no fix path from view mode. 45-char name breaks chip layout (verified). Escape discards dialog deletions silently (verified). Mid-OAuth refresh acceptable (status re-resolves).

## Minor Observations

- Catalog description leaks roadmap language: "the foundation for one-click Workers telemetry" (`integration-catalog.tsx:46-47`).
- CF entry lacks `docsUrl` — only drill-in without a Docs link.
- Explainer box appears only when the dialog _opened_ empty (`variables-manager-dialog.tsx:151, 205`); deleting all rows shows just the button.
- Variables chip collapses to unlabeled `+` once ≥1 variable exists (`variable-selects.tsx:57`).
- Zone tooltips use native `title` with `\n` joins — inconsistent with styled tooltips, unavailable to keyboard/touch (`cloudflare-account-card.tsx:107-114`).
- `disabled` chip during options load drops out of tab order mid-hydration (`variable-selects.tsx:117`).
- Dialog `sm:max-w-xl` may grow unboundedly with many variables (scroll cap unverified).
- Staggered catalog entrance animation (P3, see Anti-Patterns).

## Questions to Consider

1. Why is variable management modal-gated behind edit mode? A viewer wondering what the `service` chip does has no path to inspect its definition.
2. The CF card shows "proof of ingest" — why doesn't each zone row link to a pre-filtered traces/logs view so proof becomes payoff?
3. If `analyticsCapable` can be false, what else can partially degrade — will one banner scale to per-dataset scopes, or is a permissions readout needed?
