# bench-queries — ClickHouse query benchmarking

A small CLI for measuring the real cost of our dashboard queries.

It replays the exact SQL we already ran in production (captured on every
`WarehouseQueryService.executeSql` span as `db.query.text`), records wall-time
+ server-side stats + EXPLAIN plans, and lets you diff two runs so you can
prove whether a DSL change actually moved the number.

## Commands

```
bun bench:fetch    [--context name] [--profile name] [--since 24h]
                   [--top 20] [--out path] [--org id]
                   # mine recent db.query.text spans from prod traces → JSON

bun bench:run      <file> [--runs 5] [--warmup 1] [--out path]
                   # replay each query N times and report aggregated stats

bun bench:inspect  <file>
                   # run EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN PIPELINE for each query

bun bench:compare  <a.json> <b.json>
                   # diff two run outputs (p95 wall, read bytes, memory)
```

Output JSONs land in `apps/api/scripts/.bench/` by default (gitignored).

## Implementation

Built on Effect v4 end-to-end:

- **CLI** — `effect/unstable/cli` (`Command` / `Flag` / `Argument`). The command
  tree gives `--help`, per-subcommand help, `--version`, shell `--completions`,
  and arg validation for free; no hand-rolled parser.
- **Runtime** — `@effect/platform-bun` `BunRuntime.runMain` with
  `BunServices.layer` providing the CLI `Environment` (FileSystem, Path,
  Terminal, Stdio). Exits non-zero on failure with structured error logging.
- **Config** — env resolved via `Config` (`CLICKHOUSE_*`, `TINYBIRD_*`).
- **Errors** — `Schema.TaggedErrorClass`: `MissingConfigError`,
  `HttpRequestError`, `UpstreamStatusError`, `BenchFileError`,
  `InvalidDurationError`.
- **Services** — ClickHouse + Tinybird HTTP clients as `Context.Service`s wired
  through a `Layer`; file IO via the core `FileSystem` service. Each subcommand
  handler is an `Effect.fn` so its span name shows up in traces.

## Env

The tool resolves env vars with Effect's `Config` (not `Env.layer`), so it
works in a checkout that doesn't have the full API config (Clerk keys, ingest
secrets, etc.) set up. You only need warehouse credentials.

| Var                       | Required by              | Purpose                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `TINYBIRD_HOST`           | `fetch`                  | Source — where prod self-instrumentation lives |
| `TINYBIRD_TOKEN`          | `fetch`                  | Bearer token for the Tinybird workspace    |
| `CLICKHOUSE_URL`          | `run`, `inspect`         | Target — where we replay queries           |
| `CLICKHOUSE_USER`         | `run`, `inspect`         | Default `default`                          |
| `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`     | `run`, `inspect`         | Empty when CH allows anonymous local conns |
| `CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE`     | `run`, `inspect`         | Default `default`                          |
| `MAPLE_INTERNAL_ORG_ID`   | `fetch` (optional)       | Default `internal` — matches the gateway   |

`run` and `inspect` deliberately do **not** support a Tinybird-SDK fallback.
They need `query_id` and `system.query_log` for memory + ProfileEvents, which
only the raw ClickHouse HTTP interface exposes.

## Worked example — optimizing `errorsByType`

1. **Capture baseline.** Pull the recent slow queries for one context label:

   ```
   bun bench:fetch --context errorsByType --since 24h --top 5 \
     --out .bench/errorsByType-baseline.json
   ```

   Skim the table to confirm the queries look real — they should start with
   `SELECT`, contain `OrgId =`, and the p95 column should match the staging
   trace dashboard.

2. **Measure baseline.** Replay them locally, 5 runs each:

   ```
   bun bench:run .bench/errorsByType-baseline.json --runs 5 \
     --out .bench/errorsByType-before.json
   ```

   Look at `read bytes` and `mem` — those are usually the more interesting
   columns than wall time for a managed-CH dashboard query.

3. **Inspect the plan.** Find out what ClickHouse is doing:

   ```
   bun bench:inspect .bench/errorsByType-baseline.json
   ```

   In particular, EXPLAIN PIPELINE shows whether the optimizer collapsed
   filters into a `PREWHERE` and how many threads it's using.

4. **Iterate on the DSL.** Edit
   [packages/query-engine/src/ch/queries/errors.ts](../../../packages/query-engine/src/ch/queries/errors.ts)
   — add a `PREWHERE`, narrow the projection, switch from `Traces` to an
   already-aggregated MV, whatever the EXPLAIN suggested.

5. **Re-run.** Either deploy the change to staging and run `bench:fetch`
   again (so the new fingerprint shows up in traces), or hand-edit the SQL in
   a copy of the baseline JSON for a faster local loop. Then:

   ```
   bun bench:run .bench/errorsByType-after-prewhere.json --runs 5 \
     --out .bench/errorsByType-after.json
   ```

6. **Diff.** Confirm the change actually helped:

   ```
   bun bench:compare .bench/errorsByType-before.json .bench/errorsByType-after.json
   ```

   The compare table prints absolute and percentage deltas for p95 wall,
   read bytes, and memory. Negative numbers mean improvement.

## Notes

- **Warmup matters.** ClickHouse caches mark ranges and column blocks
  aggressively. The default of 1 warmup run + 5 timed runs is enough to
  separate cold-vs-warm without dominating the bench duration.
- **`system.query_log` is buffered ~7s.** The script retries a few times to
  pick up `memory_usage` and `read_rows` after each run, then falls back to
  the `X-ClickHouse-Summary` header values it captured at execution time.
- **The mining query itself runs against Tinybird** because that's where the
  `internal`-org self-instrumentation lands. The replays go against
  `CLICKHOUSE_URL`. You can point those at different deployments.
- **Source SQL is byte-for-byte what production ran.** Resolved params,
  `OrgId` filter, profile `SETTINGS` clause — all already baked in by
  `WarehouseQueryService.executeSql` before the span was emitted.
