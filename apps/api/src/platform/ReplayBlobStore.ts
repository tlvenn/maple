// ReplayBlobStore — reads rrweb chunk payloads out of R2.
//
// The ingest gateway stores each replay chunk's gzipped rrweb array as an
// object and writes a `session_replay_events` row that carries only the chunk's
// metadata, with an empty `Events`. This service turns those rows back into the
// inline payloads the player already expects, so the HTTP response shape is
// unchanged.
//
// Two states are normal, not errors:
//
//   - **No binding.** Self-hosted installs and the Docker image of this API have
//     no R2. `WorkerEnvironment` resolves to `{}` outside a Worker isolate, so
//     `bindOptional` yields `None` and hydration becomes a no-op.
//   - **Non-empty `events` on a row.** That row predates the R2 cutover (or came
//     from a BYO-ClickHouse org, which never stops writing inline). It passes
//     through untouched. This is the dual-read, and it is the whole migration
//     strategy: no backfill, the old rows age out on the table's 30-day TTL.
