/**
 * The AI-triage investigation loop, in process.
 *
 * This replaces the Flue `triage` workflow (`apps/chat-flue/src/workflows/triage.ts`) and, with it,
 * the whole `apps/api -> CHAT_FLUE -> MCP-over-HTTP -> apps/api` round trip: Maple's MCP tools and
 * `@maple/llm`'s `Tool` abstraction are both Effect Schema, so the tools are a direct wrap of
 * `mapleToolDefinitions` and `callMcpTool` with no JSON-Schema-to-Valibot bridge in between.
 *
 * Shape of a run:
 *
 *   1. `LLM.generate` with the read-only tool allowlist bound.
 *   2. For each `tool-call` event, `ToolRuntime.dispatch` -> append the assistant turn and the
 *      `ToolResultPart`s -> repeat. Capped by `MAX_TOOL_STEPS`.
 *   3. Once the model stops calling tools (or the cap is hit), `LLM.generateObject` against
 *      `AiTriageResult` from `@maple/domain/http` — the canonical schema, so the hand-maintained
 *      Valibot mirror in `apps/chat-flue/src/lib/triage-result.ts` is gone.
 *
 * `ToolRuntime` deliberately exports only `dispatch` for a single call; the multi-turn loop that
 * Flue's `session.prompt` used to hide is owned here, where the step cap and the allowlist are
 * visible.
