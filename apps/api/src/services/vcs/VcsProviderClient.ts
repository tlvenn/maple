	 *
	 * Being cut short is NOT an error: on a rate limit, OR after a bounded number of
	 * pages (so one invocation's wall-clock stays under the queue limit), the provider
	 * returns what it fetched plus `VcsCommitFetch.next` (resume cursor + delay +
	 * reason). Failures: `VcsInstallationGoneError` (disconnect),
	 * `VcsRepoUnavailableError` (repo-scoped), `VcsProviderError` (transient).
	 *
	 * ORDERING CONTRACT (load-bearing — read before implementing a new provider):
	 * when the walk is cut short, the returned commits MUST be the descending-
	 * committer-date *prefix* of the requested `(sinceMs, untilMs]` window — i.e. the
	 * provider must walk the window newest-first, and a truncated page must contain
	 * the newest commits in the window, contiguously, with no gap. The resume
	 * watermark is `min(committedAt)` of the page, so the caller assumes everything
	 * from that watermark up to `untilMs` is fully fetched and resumes *below* it.
	 * A provider that truncates a page out of committer-date order (oldest-first or
	 * arbitrary) would push the watermark down past commits it never returned, and
	 * those commits are then silently skipped forever — a coverage gap, not a crash.
	 * (An *untruncated* page — `next` absent — may be in any order; the requirement
	 * only bites on truncation.) GitHub satisfies this because its commits listing is
	 * newest-first; any new provider must guarantee the same.
