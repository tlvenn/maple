 * identically on every tick — retrying each 1–5 min only burns quota and floods
 * the error dashboards. When a tick's per-org failure carries such an error,
 * the org is parked in the edge cache and skipped until the TTL expires, which
 * doubles as the automatic retry once the org's config is repaired.
 *
 * Scoped to warehouse-connectivity errors only: transient upstream failures
