 * The one place the warehouse error union is enumerated for `Effect.catchTags`.

 * means updating this table (and the meta Record in `@maple/domain`) instead of
 * one hand-written 9-arm table per surface. The handler receives the union
 * (every member is assignable), so the residual error channel still infers
 * correctly at the call site.
