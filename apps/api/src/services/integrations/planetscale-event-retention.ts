 * Retention for the PlanetScale lifecycle timeline (`planetscale_events`).
 *
 * The table is small by design — tens of rows per org per day — but it is
 * append-only from two sources with no upper bound, and a 30-day REST backfill
 * on a busy org can land thousands of rows at once. Two limits, mirroring
 * `scrape-check-retention.ts`: an age cutoff that matches how far back the
 * charts are useful, and a per-org row cap as a backstop.
 *
 * Runs from the API worker's existing hourly retention cron rather than its own
 * schedule — every new cron string costs an entry in both `wrangler.jsonc` and
 * `alchemy.run.ts`, and this has no reason to tick on a different beat.
