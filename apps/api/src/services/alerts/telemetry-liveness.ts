 * Every path that reads an absent symptom as health has to answer that first.
 * An ingest outage, a sampling change, a renamed service, or an org hitting its
 * billing limit (the gateway 402s and drops the spans) are all indistinguishable
 * from a fixed incident if you only look at the alerting signal itself.
 *
 * The probe compares a verification window against a baseline window ending at
 * incident onset, so it answers "did the traffic that produced this incident go
 * away?" rather than "is there traffic right now" — a service that was always
 * quiet must not be permanently ineligible for resolution.
 *
 * Fail-closed: a probe that errors returns `dataFlowing: false`. Not resolving
 * is recoverable on the next tick; resolving a live incident is not.
 *
 * The verdict maths is pure and lives at the bottom of this file (mirroring the
 * split in services/anomaly/state-machine.ts) so the interesting decisions are
 * testable without standing up a warehouse.
