// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Hourly spend-limit evaluation.
//
// Turns configuration into enforcement: for every org that has set a ceiling or
// a cap, price the cycle from Autumn and stamp the result on `org_spend_limits`,
// where the ingest gateway reads it as a single boolean per request. Pricing in
// the gateway's hot path is not an option — it resolves keys from Postgres with
// no Autumn client at all — so this cron is the only thing standing between a
// configured limit and a 402.
//
// The work-list is deliberately narrow: only orgs with a configured ceiling or
// cap (SpendLimitsService.listConfigured filters the rest), because each entry
// costs two Autumn round-trips per tick. An org that never opened the card costs
// nothing.
