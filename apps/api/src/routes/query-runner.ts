/**
 * Execute registry-declared warehouse queries.
 *
 * This is the single place that applies a `QueryDef`'s cost profile, settings,
 * span context, error label and cache policy — the five things that used to be
 * hand-repeated in each of 61 handlers, where the cache in particular was
 * silently omitted 50 times.
 *
 * Handlers keep their own row-to-response mapping. What they lose is the
 * plumbing, not the presentation.
 *
 * The services are taken as VALUES, not read from context, and the runners are
 * built once per handler group. That is load-bearing rather than stylistic:
 * `QueryEngineService.cachedDirect` accepts an `Effect` with no requirements, so
 * a context-reading runner could never be composed inside a cache wrapper —
 * which `spanHierarchy` needs, since its probe must only fire on a cache miss.
 * Currying here keeps every call site written as `runQuery(def, tenant, payload)`
 * while the effects it returns carry `R = never`.
