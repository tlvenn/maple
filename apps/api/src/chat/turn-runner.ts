/**
 * Running one chat turn, inside the `ChatSession` Durable Object.
 *
 * This module is the heavy half of the DO: the Effect runtime, the app service graph and
 * `@maple/llm`. `ChatSession.ts` reaches it through a dynamic import for the same reason
 * `worker.ts` dynamic-imports its route graph — the static graph builds hundreds of Schema ASTs at
 * module scope, which would blow Cloudflare's ~1s startup-CPU budget (error 10021) on a class that
 * is exported from the worker entry.
 *
 * Two things changed shape when the turn moved in here:
 *
 *   - **Appends are method calls.** The turn used to run in the request that submitted the message
 *     and write back over the DO stub, one RPC per token delta. It now holds the object itself.
 *   - **`submit_diagnosis` resolves itself.** It used to be threaded in as a callback from three
 *     call sites, because `InvestigationService` starting an investigation's own turn would have
 *     made the service require itself through the Effect requirements channel. Here the turn builds
 *     its *own* runtime, so it just resolves `InvestigationService` — no cycle, and no
 *     `env: workerEnv ?? {}` fallback silently degrading the model config when a caller forgot to
 *     thread the worker env through.
