/**
 * `ChatSession` — the durable transcript, one Durable Object per `"<orgId>:<tabId>"`.
 *
 * Replaces Flue's `FlueMapleChatAgent` + `FlueRegistry` SQLite Durable Objects. The DO owns four
 * things:
 *
 *   1. **Ordering.** It assigns every event a monotonic `seq`. That is what makes the client
 *      transport resumable by construction: reconnect is `?cursor=<last seq you saw>`, not a
 *      heuristic about whether you missed something.
 *   2. **The event log**, in SQLite, replayed on reconnect and folded into a transcript on cold
 *      load. Both roles replay, so a conversation opened on another device is complete.
 *   3. **Turn lifecycle** — at most one turn in flight, abortable, and self-healing.
 *   4. **Running the turn.** The turn executes *here*, under `ctx.waitUntil` on the DO's own
 *      request context, not in whichever request asked for it.
 *
 * That last point is the load-bearing one. A turn is a multi-second model stream plus N tool
 * calls; the `POST /messages` request that starts it answers in milliseconds. Forking the turn off
 * that request and returning meant Cloudflare was free to cancel it the moment the response was
 * written — and the autonomous path was worse, since cron ticks run under `runScheduledEffect`,
 * which disposes the Effect runtime as soon as the tick's program settles. A Durable Object owns
 * its own lifetime, so hosting the turn here is what actually makes it survive. It also removes
 * every cross-process hop: appending an event is a method call, not a stub RPC.
 *
 * Startup-CPU note (Cloudflare error 10021): this class is exported from `worker.ts`, whose module
 * scope Cloudflare evaluates during upload validation. It must therefore import nothing from the
 * app service graph at module scope — hence `@maple/domain/chat-session` types being the only
 * import, and `./turn-runner` (which pulls in the whole graph) arriving through a dynamic import
 * inside the method that needs it, exactly as `worker.ts` does for the route graph.
