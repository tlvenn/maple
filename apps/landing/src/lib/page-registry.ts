/**
 * Shared types and helpers for the feature and use-case registries.
 *
 * Two rules govern everything in this file and its two consumers:
 *
 * 1. **Messages are stored as thunks, never as called values.** Paraglide
 *    resolves the active locale per call, through an AsyncLocalStorage the
 *    astro integration sets up around each page render. A module-scope
 *    `title: m.x()` would evaluate once at module-eval time and freeze
 *    whichever locale happened to render first — so every page in the build
 *    would inherit it. Store the function reference and let the template call
 *    it. `NavBar.tsx` already uses this exact `() => string` shape.
 *
 *    The same rule is why `getStaticPaths()` must never call a message either:
 *    it runs outside that storage and always resolves to the source locale.
 *
 * 2. **No `.astro` and no `astro:i18n` imports here.** `NavBar.tsx` is a
 *    `client:load` island that reads these registries, so anything imported
 *    here ships to the browser. Component references live in
 *    `components/page/slots.ts`, which only the templates import; paths are
 *    built by the pure helpers below rather than by `getRelativeLocaleUrl`.
