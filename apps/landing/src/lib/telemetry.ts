/**
 * Maple's own browser telemetry on the marketing site.
 *
 * We sell session replay and product analytics, so the landing site runs the
 * public `@maple-dev/browser` SDK exactly as a customer would — same package,
 * same config surface. Two things follow from that:
 *
 * - The visitor id is a cookie scoped to the registered domain (see
 *   `packages/browser-session/src/visitor.ts`), so a visit to `maple.dev` and
 *   the session that follows on `app.maple.dev` resolve to the *same*
 *   `VisitorId`. That is the join that makes "which campaign produced this
 *   signup" answerable — the session ids stay separate on purpose.
 *
 * Privacy posture matches what the site already did with its third-party
 * analytics tag: no consent gate, inputs masked, and Global Privacy Control
 * honored by default (it suppresses the persistent visitor id).
