export const listicleFaqs: Array<{ question: string; answer: string }> = [
	{
		question: "What is the best open-source observability tool in 2026?",
		answer: "There's no single winner — it depends on how your team works. Maple is the strongest fit for OpenTelemetry-native teams that want AI-agent (MCP) workflows and usage-based pricing; Grafana's LGTM stack is best when you want maximum flexibility and don't mind operating several components; SigNoz is a great all-in-one OTel-native APM. Match the tool to the “Best for” line rather than the rank.",
	},
	{
		question: "Are open-source observability platforms production-ready?",
		answer: "Yes. Several are CNCF-graduated (Jaeger, Prometheus) and others run large production workloads today. Open source here means you can self-host, audit the code, and avoid vendor lock-in — not that the tools are experimental.",
	},
	{
		question: "Why does OpenTelemetry matter when choosing an observability tool?",
		answer: "OpenTelemetry is the vendor-neutral standard for traces, logs, and metrics. Instrumenting with OpenTelemetry means you can switch backends without re-instrumenting your code, so OTel-native tools like Maple, SigNoz, and Uptrace avoid the lock-in of proprietary agents.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I self-host all of these tools?",
		answer: "Yes — every tool in this roundup can be self-hosted. Maple, SigNoz, HyperDX, and Uptrace are ClickHouse-backed; the Grafana stack uses Loki/Tempo/Mimir; Jaeger and Prometheus are CNCF projects. Several also offer a managed cloud option if you'd rather not run the infrastructure.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is open-source observability cheaper than SaaS tools like Datadog?",
		answer: "Often, yes — especially at scale, where SaaS per-host and per-GB pricing compounds. Self-hosting trades software fees for infrastructure and operational time. Tools with usage-based pricing or cheap object storage (Maple, OpenObserve) keep costs predictable without you operating everything yourself.",
	},
	{
		question: "Which open-source tool is best for AI agents?",
		answer: "Maple ships a first-class MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, so compatible AI agents can list services, search traces, find errors, and propose fixes directly against your telemetry — the most complete AI-agent story among the tools here.",
	},
