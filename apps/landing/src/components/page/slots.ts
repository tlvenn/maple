/**
 * Slug → component maps.
 *
 * These live outside `lib/features.ts` on purpose: `NavBar.tsx` is a
 * `client:load` island that reads the registry, so anything the registry
 * imports ships to the browser. The registry stores string ids; this module —
 * imported only by the two Astro templates — resolves them to components.
 *
 * Astro renders a capitalised local as a component, so the templates do
 * `const Artifact = ARTIFACTS[id]` then `<Artifact />`.
 *
 * Every entry is an Astro component. The two React artifacts are wrapped in
 * thin `.astro` files under `artifacts/`, because Astro builds a hydration
 * script from the static import at the call site — a component resolved out of
 * this map has no import path and cannot take a `client:*` directive.
