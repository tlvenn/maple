/**
 * Thread follow-up promotion: lets users keep talking to the bot in a thread
 * without re-@-mentioning it on every message.
 *
 * eve's Slack channel only dispatches `app_mention` events and DMs
 * (`message` with `channel_type: "im"`); a plain reply in a channel thread
 * arrives as a `message.channels` / `message.groups` event and is dropped as
 * `unsupported` before any handler runs. Rather than patching eve's parser,
 * we exploit the fact that our custom `webhookVerifier` returns the body eve
 * parses downstream: when a thread reply qualifies as a follow-up to a
 * conversation the bot is engaged in, we rewrite `event.type` to
 * `"app_mention"` so eve treats it exactly like a mention — same session
 * (continuation token is `channelId:threadTs`), same incremental
 * `threadContext`, same event-id dedupe.
 *
 * A reply qualifies when ALL of:
 *   - it is a threaded `message` in a channel/group (not a thread root, not a
 *     DM — DMs already dispatch on their own);
 *   - it is user-authored (no `bot_id`, no subtype except `file_share` —
 *     mirrors eve's own DM filter, and keeps the bot's replies from
 *     re-triggering itself);
 *   - it does NOT already @-mention the bot (those arrive as a separate,
 *     real `app_mention` event; promoting the `message` twin would double-
 *     dispatch the same turn);
 *   - the bot is "engaged" in the thread: it has posted there, or someone
 *     mentioned it there (covers the follow-up racing ahead of the bot's
 *     first reply) — and that engagement is still RECENT (see
 *     `ENGAGEMENT_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` / `ENGAGEMENT_RECENT_MESSAGE_WINDOW`).
 *
 * Requires the Slack app to subscribe to `message.channels` (public) /
 * `message.groups` (private) bot events; the engagement check reuses the
 * `channels:history` / `groups:history` scopes that `threadContext` already
 * needs. The bot only receives channel messages for channels it is a member
 * of, which naturally bounds the event volume.
