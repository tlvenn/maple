/**
 * Structured agent logging — the eve-native port of chat-flue's
 * `emitTelemetryLog` (apps/chat-flue/src/lib/telemetry.ts).
 *
 * Two reasons this exists instead of bare `console.log`:
 *
 *  1. **Reachability.** These lines (turn outcomes, tool failures) are the
 *     primary signal for the "agent did nothing" failure mode. Left on stdout
 *     they die in Railway's log pane, which is not queryable and not where
 *     anyone looks. Routed through the OTel logger they land in Maple next to
 *     the spans they belong to, correlated by trace/span id.
 *  2. **Structure.** Interpolated `key=value` prose is not queryable at all;
 *     attributes are. The console fallback emits JSON for the same reason.
 *
 * The logger provider is registered by agent/instrumentation.ts (NodeSDK's
 * `logRecordProcessors`). Until it is — MAPLE_INGEST_KEY unset, i.e. local dev
 * — `@opentelemetry/api-logs` hands out a no-op logger that silently drops
 * everything, so we track activation explicitly and fall back to the console.
