/**
 * Shared TTL map for this app's small, credential-bearing in-memory caches.
 *
 * A plain `Map<string, { expiresAt }>` never actually forgets anything: an
 * entry is only ever replaced by a fresh lookup for the SAME key, so a key
 * that stops being looked up — a workspace that uninstalled the app, a thread
 * that went quiet — stays resident for the life of the process. "Expired"
 * ends up meaning "not served" rather than "gone", which is fine for a
 * boolean and not fine for the workspace cache, whose entries hold a
 * decrypted Slack bot token and a full-access Maple API key.
 *
 * So expiry is enforced three ways:
 *   - on read: an expired entry is deleted, not just ignored;
 *   - on write: a full sweep of expired entries (rate-limited to once per
 *     `sweepIntervalMs` so a hot cache doesn't walk itself on every set),
 *     plus oldest-insertion eviction once `maxEntries` is reached, so the map
 *     cannot grow without bound even if nothing has expired yet;
 *   - in the background: a self-stopping timer sweep, so a process that goes
 *     idle — the case no access-triggered sweep can ever reach — does not sit
 *     on live-ish credentials until the next event arrives. The timer is
 *     `unref`'d and clears itself once the cache is empty, so it neither
 *     holds the process open nor ticks forever on an unused cache.
