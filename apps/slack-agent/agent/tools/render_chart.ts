/**
 * Renders a time-series chart as a PNG and posts it into the current Slack
 * thread (beyond chat-flue parity — chat-flue renders no images anywhere).
 *
 * Render happens in-process (hand-rolled SVG → @resvg/resvg-js), no headless
 * browser or external chart service — an external URL-based renderer would
 * leak org telemetry into URLs. Delivery is Slack's external-upload flow with
 * the per-team bot token, so the image lives in the customer's workspace under
 * Slack's ACLs. On render/upload failure the tool degrades to a Unicode
 * sparkline the model can inline in its reply.
 *
 * THE FILENAME IS THE TOOL NAME. eve derives it from the path with no
 * kebab→snake normalization and `defineTool()` takes no `name` field, so
 * renaming this file to `render-chart.ts` silently renames the tool while
 * `agent/instructions.md` still tells the model to call `render_chart` —
 * i.e. an unreachable tool, no error anywhere. Behaviour lives in
 * `agent/lib/render-chart.ts` (every module under `agent/tools/` registers as
 * a tool, so helpers cannot live here); this file stays the adapter from
 * eve's tool contract to it.
