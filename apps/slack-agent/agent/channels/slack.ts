/**
 * Multi-workspace, self-managed Slack app — no Vercel Connect.
 *
 * The Slack signing secret is per-app/static (`SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`); only the
 * *bot token* varies per workspace. So we:
 *   1. Verify every inbound webhook's v0 signature with the static secret in a
 *      custom `webhookVerifier`.
 *   2. Resolve the outbound bot token per team via Maple's resolve endpoint.
 *      Our patched eve (patches/eve@0.25.3.patch, tracking vercel/eve#222)
 *      passes `{ teamId, channelId, threadTs }` into the credential;
 *      `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is the fallback for single-workspace dev and
 *      context-less paths.
 *
 * Slack delivers events to POST /eve/v1/slack.
