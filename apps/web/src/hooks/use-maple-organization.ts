 * The organization the **API** resolved this session to, or `null` while that is
 * still loading.
 *
 * This deliberately does not read Clerk's active organization. The server is the
 * authority on which tenant a session belongs to, and the two do not always
 * agree: `packages/auth` resolves `MAPLE_ORG_ID_OVERRIDE ?? auth.orgId`, and in
 * self-hosted mode the org comes from the session token rather than a constant.
 * A client-side guess that disagrees fails silently and totally — the chat
 * addresses its agent as `"<orgId>:<tabId>"`, so a wrong org opens a conversation
 * nobody else can see, and an investigation's thread stays empty forever with no
 * error raised anywhere.
 *
 * `GET /api/auth/session` returns the resolved tenant, and other hooks already
 * read this same atom, so this costs no extra request.
