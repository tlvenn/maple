 * Derives commit deploy markers from the release timeline and returns the chart

 * per-SHA query resolves. A single derived atom (`markersAtom`) reads each
 * resolvable marker's `commitQueryAtom(sha)` — subscribing to it both drives the
 * relabel and primes the shared cache, so opening the hover card is a cache hit
 * (no null-rendering subscriber components needed).
