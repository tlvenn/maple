// Setup progression for the PlanetScale integration.
//
// Connecting PlanetScale is genuinely two-part and the UI used to hide that. The
// OAuth grant covers the management plane (inventory, query insights, webhooks),
// but PlanetScale's metrics data plane only accepts service tokens — so the
// bearer probe almost always fails and a freshly-connected org sits at
// `metricsAuth: "missing"` with a paused scrape target. Presenting that as a
// warning badge on an otherwise "Connected" card taught people the integration
// was broken. Presenting it as step 3 of 4 teaches them it isn't finished.
//
// Pure — no React, no atoms — so the progression rules are testable on their own
// (same shape as branch-selection.ts).
