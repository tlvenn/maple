// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Replay event-stream normalization
//
// The player concatenates a session's rrweb chunk blobs into one event array.
// Sessions recorded before chunk sequences became monotonic-per-session can
// carry duplicate/overwritten chunk-index rows whose blobs decode out of order,
// so the concatenated stream may be scrambled or contain duplicates. rrweb's
// `getMetaData().totalTime` (last − first timestamp) and the player's
// idle-collapse both assume a clean, chronologically-ordered stream — feed them
// a corrupted one and the reported length balloons to the whole tab lifetime.
//
// `normalizeEvents` repairs the stream so those legacy sessions stay playable.
