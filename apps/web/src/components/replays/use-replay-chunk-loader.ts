//
// The player used to fetch a session's entire rrweb payload before rendering a
// frame. Ingest accepts up to 1 GiB per session and the p99 is ~594 MB, so on a
// long session that read died in the Worker and surfaced as a 503 blaming the
// database. Now: seed from a checkpoint, play, and pull the rest as it's needed.
//
// Ranges load one at a time. Sequential is not a limitation here — playback
// consumes chunks in order, so a second in-flight range would only ever be the
// one after the range already being fetched. One subscription also keeps this a
// plain hook instead of an imperative registry subscription per range.
