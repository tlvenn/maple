// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The widget-type framework.
//
// A `WidgetTypeDefinition` is everything the app needs to know about one kind of
// widget: how to draw it, how to configure it, how to lower its editor state to
// a persisted `dataSource` + `display`, and when that state is invalid. Adding a
// widget type is a new file under `./types/` plus one line in `widgetTypes`.
//
// Before this, the same twelve types were described by ~35 scattered edit sites:
// four if-chains in `widget-builder-utils.ts`, nine boolean flags in the settings
// rail, nine more in the picker, four forked copies of the default grid size, and
// a `Record<string, Component>` that fell back to a line chart on a typo.
//
// The type-agnostic half — labels, layout, owned display keys, MCP exposure,
// Perses kinds — lives in `@maple/domain` so the API and the MCP tools read the
// same table. This module adds the parts that only exist in a browser.
