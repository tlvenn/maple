 * the 2-column remainder, and then floats short tiles up into whatever holes
 * the clamping opened. The result reads as scattered rather than as a grid.
 *
 * Instead: scale every width proportionally (with `minSpan` as a floor), pack
 * widgets into rows in reading order, and justify each row so it fills the
 * width exactly. Rows stay rows, order is preserved, and nothing overlaps —
