// The vocabulary of absence for the PlanetScale surfaces.

// A dash on these pages has six different causes, and they have six different
// fixes: metrics were never enabled, the branch is excluded from scraping, the
// OAuth grant was revoked, the inventory poller is stalled, the window has no
// samples, or the query failed. Rendering all six as a bare "—" (which is what
// this integration did) makes an unmonitored database indistinguishable from a
// healthy idle one.
//
// Every surface — the fleet page, the drill-in, the service-map panel — reads
// its copy from here, so the same cause always reads the same way.
