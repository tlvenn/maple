// Branch resolution for the PlanetScale database drill-in.
//
// A PlanetScale database is not one thing: production plus one branch per open
// pull request, which in practice means tens of branches, nearly all idle. Two
// consequences drive this module:
//
//  1. The default scope has to be the production branch. Falling back to
//     "whichever branch has the most connections" would be right by accident on
//     a healthy database and wrong the moment production goes quiet.
//  2. The branch list has to come from the inventory UNION the metric rollups.
//     Building it from metrics alone silently drops branches excluded from
//     scraping or asleep, leaving no way to tell "no such branch" from "no data".
//
// Pure — no React, no atoms — so the precedence rules are testable on their own.
