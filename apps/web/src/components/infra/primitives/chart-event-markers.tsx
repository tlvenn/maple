// Discrete events drawn onto a time-series chart.
//
// A utilization chart answers "what happened"; it can't answer "why". A deploy
// marker next to a CPU cliff turns two separate investigations into one glance.
// Nothing shared existed for this — `ReferenceLine` appears in six charts in
// this codebase and every one of them is a horizontal threshold, not an event.
//
// Two things make this non-trivial and are the reason it lives here rather than
// inline in one chart:
//
//  1. **The x-axis is categorical.** These charts plot bucket *labels* produced
//     by `makeBucketLabeler`, not timestamps, and those labels are not unique
//     over a multi-day window ("14:00" appears once per day). A marker therefore
//     has to be snapped by bucket *index* and then read its label back out.
//  2. **Recharts requires ReferenceLine/ReferenceArea to be direct children** of
//     the chart element, so this exports a fragment-returning function to call
//     inside `<LineChart>`, not a wrapper component around it.
