/**
 * The issues-list selection state as a pure unitflow reducer — the first real
 * adoption of `@maple/unitflow/reducer`. Multi-select with shift-range and a
 * clear action is exactly the "complex interactive local state" a reducer is
 * for: every transition flows through one exhaustive `update`, so the
 * shift-anchor logic (the fiddly part) is testable as plain data instead of
 * living in a `useState` + `useRef` + imperative-handler tangle in the route.
 *
 * The reducer lives outside the route so the shift-range behavior stays
 * independently testable. The route adapts its `[state, command]` result to
 * React's `useReducer`; URL-backed filters remount that keyed subtree.
