/**
 * The web app's unitflow runtime: model layers composed over the shared typed
 * API client layer (the same `mapleApiClientLayer` the imperative
 * `mapleRuntime` uses, so model queries carry auth + OTel like every other
 * call). One runtime for all models — mounted by the `<Unitflow>` root at the
 * routes that use models.
 *
 * The runtime shares `Atom.runtime`'s layer memo map. That is load-bearing:
 * layers both worlds use — notably `Reactivity.layer` — build ONCE and resolve
 * the same instance, so `reactivityKeys` invalidations fired by atom mutations
 * (e.g. `useAtomSet(...mutation..., { reactivityKeys })`) are observable from
 * inside models. Without the shared memo map each runtime would construct its
 * own `Reactivity` and the two would be deaf to each other.
