// Buffer-backed client telemetry with flush-on-unload. `Maple.layer`
// (`Otlp.layerJson`) exports on a 5s timer and never flushes on `pagehide`, so
// the tail of a session — including a page's root query span, which finishes
// last after its child queries — was silently dropped before the next tick on a
// hard nav/tab-close, leaving rootless traces. `MapleFlush` swaps in the
// buffer-backed tracer and registers `pagehide` + `visibilitychange→hidden`
// handlers (on by default) that drain the buffer before the tab goes away.
// Traces, logs, and Effect metrics share the same unload-safe flush.
// `service.namespace` moves into `attributes` because
// the flushable config has no dedicated field for it.
