// Throttled, non-blocking "update available" notice before dispatching the
// command. It never fails and short-circuits to a cached decision on most runs
// (network is hit at most once per 24h), so the latency cost is negligible.
//
// `cli.argv` records the sub-command + flags so one root span per invocation
// ties a command to the warehouse queries it runs. TelemetryLayer is provided
// OUTERMOST (after MainLayer), not merged into it: the OTLP tracer's batch
// exporter flushes when its layer scope closes, and only the outermost provide's
// scope is the runtime's main scope that `BunRuntime.runMain` closes on exit.
// Merging it into MainLayer leaves spans unflushed for short-lived commands.
