/**
 * Provides `WarehouseExecutor` whose concrete backend (local chDB vs remote
 * warehouse) is resolved lazily, on first query — NOT at layer-build time.
 *
 * This matters because `Command.run`'s requirement union includes
 * WarehouseExecutor even for commands that never query (login/logout/whoami).
 * Resolving the mode eagerly at build time would make those commands fail when
 * no backend is configured. Deferring resolution into the methods keeps the
 * layer always-constructible, while `Effect.cached` resolves the mode at most
 * once per process.
 *
 * Note: `orgId` is intentionally empty. No CLI command reads `executor.orgId`
 * (the local executor injects "local" and the remote server injects the tenant
 * org), so it is never used on this path.
