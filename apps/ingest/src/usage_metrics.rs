//! Per-org ingest volume metrics — the billable quantity, as measured.
//!
//! Distinct from `metrics.rs` in three ways, all deliberate:
//!
//! 1. **Delta temporality.** These instruments live on their own
//!    [`SdkMeterProvider`] (built by `init_usage_metrics` in `main.rs`), never on
//!    the global one, because temporality is an *exporter* setting in
//!    opentelemetry 0.31 — flipping the shared exporter would change every
//!    operational metric at once. Delta matters because each exported value is
//!    then the increment since the last export, so the warehouse can chart these
//!    with a plain `sum(Value)` per bucket. That is exact, and it survives
//!    restarts and multiple replicas. The cumulative alternative has to be read
//!    back through `metricsTimeseriesRateQuery`, which partitions on
//!    `cityHash64(ResourceAttributes)` + `StartTimeUnix` — and since
//!    `service.instance.id` is a fresh UUID per process, every deploy would lose
//!    one export interval per series to a zero first delta, while negative steps
//!    are silently dropped. Neither is acceptable for a number we reconcile
//!    against invoices.
//!
//! 2. **Per-org attribution.** `signal` alone is not enough here — the whole
//!    point is a cross-org view. Kept to exactly two attributes (`org_id`,
//!    `signal`); adding `key_type` / `destination` / `payload_format` would
//!    multiply against the per-interval cardinality limit for no analytical gain.
//!
//! 3. **Recorded at the billing call site.** `record` is called from
//!    `handle_signal`'s `Ok` arm, beside `AutumnTracker::track`, with the same
//!    `decoded_bytes` value — never from the decode site, which fires before
//!    enrich and forward and so counts payloads that were never delivered. That
//!    makes this the gateway's ground truth for what it metered, so any
//!    divergence from Autumn localises to Autumn's delivery layer.
//!
//! `signal` is `TelemetrySignal::path()` — `"logs" | "traces" | "metrics"` —
//! which are also the Autumn feature ids, so one dimension serves both.
//!
//! ## Cardinality
//!
//! Under delta temporality the SDK's `ValueMap::collect_and_reset` swaps out and
//! drains its tracker map on every collect, and the cardinality check tests that
//! same drained counter. So the limit applies **per collection interval**, not
//! per process lifetime, and orgs that go quiet stop emitting entirely rather
//! than re-exporting a stale total forever. That is why there is no hand-rolled
//! org allowlist here: the bound that matters is *concurrently active* orgs, and
//! a persistent set would misattribute every org past its ceiling while adding a
//! lock to the request hot path. [`usage_cardinality_view`] raises the limit
//! explicitly instead; past it the SDK folds excess series into a datapoint
//! tagged `otel.metric.overflow=true`, which is visible in the warehouse and is
//! the thing to alert on.
