 * Alert context delivery for the Flue chat backend. Flue's `agents.send`

 * preamble on the conversation's FIRST message. Mobile stores the user's plain
 * text locally and only prepends this block to what's sent to the agent, so the
 * preamble never shows in the user's bubble. Ported from the legacy agent's
 * `formatAlertContextBlock` so the model sees an identical context shape.
