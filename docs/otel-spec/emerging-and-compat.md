# Emerging Signals & Compatibility (Profiles, Schemas, Prometheus, Shims)

This page covers the parts of the OpenTelemetry spec tree that are either **not yet stable**
(Profiles signal, Entities) or **exist to bridge OTel with something else** (telemetry
schemas' rename/transform machinery, and the OpenCensus/OpenTracing/Prometheus compatibility
specs). Maple is primarily a _consumer_ of OTLP data and a _producer_ of its own
self-instrumentation, so this doc exists to flag: (a) data we may see on the wire that isn't
"plain" OTLP yet, (b) a signal (Profiles) we don't ingest today but should plan schema/storage
for, and (c) the principled alternative to the ad-hoc legacy-field coalescing we already do by
hand.

> **Stability key used below:** OpenTelemetry specs use a formal lifecycle — Draft → Experimental
> → Stable → Deprecated → Removed — plus, specifically for Profiles, a pre-Experimental **Alpha**
> stage. See `Source:` links per claim; do not assume anything in this file is Stable unless
> explicitly marked so.

## Relevance to Maple

- **Profiles: not ingested today.** Maple's pipeline (Rust ingest gateway → collector →
  ClickHouse/Tinybird) has no Profiles datasource, no `/v1development/profiles` route, and no
  schema for `Profile`/`Sample`/`Location`/`Function` tables. If/when we add it, expect a
  dictionary-compressed, pprof-derived shape (below), not flat rows like spans/logs — this
  changes the storage model materially (string/location/function tables are shared across
  samples within a profile, closer to how we already dedupe attribute tables than to how we
  store span rows).
- **Telemetry schemas are the principled version of what we do by hand.** CLAUDE.md documents
  that `WarehouseQueryService.executeSql` spans "coalesce both" legacy `db.statement*`/`db.system`
  and current `db.query.text`/`db.system.name` spellings, and that semconv renamed
  `deployment.environment` → `deployment.environment.name` (dual-emitted by `apps/ingest`). That
  is exactly the `rename_attributes` transform a schema file encodes formally. We do not currently
  read `schema_url` off ingested `ResourceSpans`/`ResourceLogs`/`ResourceMetrics` to drive this
  automatically — it's manual per-migration logic. This doc is the reference for what a
  schema-aware coalescing layer would look like if we ever generalize it.
- **Prometheus/OpenMetrics naming rules matter directly** if Maple ever accepts Prometheus
  remote-write, scrapes `/metrics` from anything, or exposes an OTLP→Prometheus bridge for
  customers. The `_total`/unit-suffix/`target_info` rules below are the exact translation table
  to implement or validate against.
- **OpenCensus/OpenTracing shim artifacts can show up in customer data** from services mid-migration
  (the "OpenTelemetry sandwich" pattern) — e.g., an `opentracing.ref_type` span attribute, or
  span links that originated as OpenCensus `Link`s. Both shims are now deprecated specs, so this
  is legacy-interop knowledge, not something to build new support for.
- **Entities** (pointer only) is a Development-stage remodeling of Resource that every signal,
  including Profiles, will eventually attach to — worth tracking but not actionable yet.

## 1. Profiles signal

### Status

- Signal/data-model stability: **Alpha** (pre-Experimental; explicitly "should not be used for
  critical production workloads"). `Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/profiles/`,
  `Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/status/`, `Source: https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2026/profiles-alpha/`
- Protocol (OTLP transport) stability: **Development** — the spec's own status table lists
  "Protocol: development" for profiles, distinct from the Stable protocol status for
  traces/metrics/logs. `Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/status/`
- Wire/endpoint: default path is **`/v1development/profiles`** (an `ExportProfilesServiceRequest`
  protobuf), the `v1development` path segment itself signaling non-stable status — it will drop
  to `v1` only once the proto reaches release candidate. `Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/`
- The signal entered **public Alpha on 2026-03-26**; roadmap targets Beta then GA, with GA
  originally hoped for ~Q3 2026 per community commentary (treat that date as unconfirmed —
  it's from secondary sources, not the spec itself).
  `Source: https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2026/profiles-alpha/`

Every message-level type below (`Profile`, `Sample`, `Location`, `Function`, `Mapping`, `Link`,
`ProfilesDictionary`) is itself annotated **Alpha** in the current proto.
`Source: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/profiles/v1development/profiles.proto`

### Data model shape (pprof-derived, dictionary-compressed)

The model **modifies the pprof protobuf format**, adding OTel-native concepts (Resource,
InstrumentationScope, trace/span links, semconv attributes) while preserving round-trip
conversion to/from pprof "with no loss of information."
`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/profiles/`,
`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2026/profiles-alpha/`

Key design point for a backend: **profiles are not flat sample rows.** A `ProfilesDictionary`
holds shared tables that samples reference by index, deduplicating everything that repeats
across a profile (this is conceptually the same dedup trick as an attribute/string table, just
applied to stack frames too):

- `mapping_table` (`Mapping[]`) — binary/library memory regions (load address, file offset,
  filename index) that a stack address falls into.
- `location_table` (`Location[]`) — a single stack frame: which `Mapping`, an instruction
  `address`, and one or more `Line`s (to represent inlined frames) each pointing at a `Function`.
- `function_table` (`Function[]`) — function metadata: human-readable name, system
  (e.g. mangled) name, source filename, starting line — all as string-table indices.
- `link_table` (`Link[]`) — the cross-signal join: a `trace_id` + `span_id` pair a sample can
  point at.
- `string_table` (`string[]`) — shared strings referenced everywhere else by index.
- `attribute_table` (`KeyValueAndUnit[]`) — key/value/unit triples (UCUM unit as a string index),
  referenced by index from `Profile`, `Sample`, `Location`, and `Mapping`.
- `stack_table` (`Stack[]`) — a deduplicated call stack (sequence of `Location` indices), shared
  across samples that hit the same stack.

`Profile` (the batch-level container) then carries: `sample_type` (a `ValueType` = measurement
kind + unit, e.g. `cpu`/`nanoseconds`), `samples[]`, `time_unix_nano`, `duration_nano`,
`period_type`/`period` (sampling interval descriptor), a 16-byte `profile_id`,
`dropped_attributes_count`, and optionally the **original untouched payload**
(`original_payload_format` + `original_payload` bytes) for lossless pprof round-trip.

`Sample` is the actual observation: a `stack_index` into `stack_table`, `attribute_indices` for
sample-specific attributes, `values[]` (the measured quantities — e.g. CPU ns, allocated bytes),
optional `timestamps_unix_nano[]`, and a `link_index` into `link_table` (0 = none, following the
dictionary convention that index 0 is a null sentinel throughout).
`Source: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/profiles/v1development/profiles.proto`

### Linking profiles to traces

A `Sample` MAY carry a `Link` (via `link_index` → `link_table` → `{trace_id, span_id}`),
enabling direct "what code was running during this span" correlation — the profiles concept
page frames this explicitly as answering "which code is responsible" as a complement to an
existing trace/span. Correlation otherwise happens the same way every signal correlates: shared
Resource/InstrumentationScope context.
`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/profiles/`,
`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/profiles/`

### What a backend would need to store/query profiles (implication, not spec text)

Given the shape above, ingesting Profiles is architecturally closer to ingesting a small
relational bundle per batch (dictionary tables + samples referencing them by index) than to
appending flat rows. A ClickHouse-style backend would plausibly need either (a) to materialize
the dictionary tables into their own keyed tables and resolve indices at query time, or (b) to
fully denormalize/flatten each sample (function names, file, line, mapping) at ingest — trading
storage for query simplicity, the same trade-off Maple already makes for span attributes.
Cross-signal correlation (`trace_id`/`span_id` on `Link`) is the one piece that maps cleanly onto
existing trace-join infrastructure. **Maple does not implement any of this today** — this section
is forward-looking, not a description of current behavior.

### Collector-side status (pointer, not spec)

The OpenTelemetry Collector is **not part of the specification** — it's a reference
implementation — but is worth noting as context: the 2026 Alpha announcement highlights a
`pprof` receiver, Kubernetes metadata enrichment, OTTL transforms for profiles, and an
eBPF eBPF profiling agent donated by Elastic now distributed as part of the official Collector
distribution. None of this is spec-mandated behavior.

## 2. Telemetry schemas (deep dive)

### Status

**Stable.** `Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/schemas/`

The Schema File Format sub-spec (versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0) is separately versioned; the current
file format spec (1.1.0) is marked **Development** in its own document header even though the
overall "Telemetry Schemas" concept page is Stable — read the file-format details as less settled
than the top-level mechanism.
`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/schemas/file_format_v1.1.0/`

### Why schemas exist

Semantic conventions evolve (attributes get renamed, split, etc.), but telemetry producers,
telemetry consumers, and the semantic conventions themselves all evolve independently — "the
coupling complicates the independent evolution of these 3 parties." A schema is the versioned,
machine-readable description of _what changed between semconv versions_ so a consumer can
transform old-shaped data into the shape it expects (or vice versa) without bespoke code per
field rename. `Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/schemas/`

### `schema_url` mechanics end-to-end

1. **Format:** `http[s]://server[:port]/path/<version>`. Everything before `<version>` is the
   **Schema Family** identifier — every version in a family shares that prefix.
2. **Where it's attached in OTLP:** `schema_url` fields exist on `ResourceSpans`,
   `ResourceMetrics`, `ResourceLogs` (applies to the Resource and everything nested under it) and
   separately on the `InstrumentationLibrary*`/scope-level messages (applies to just that
   scope's data). **If both are set, the scope-level value takes precedence** over the
   resource-level one for the data under that scope.
3. **Immutability + caching:** "Schema files are immutable once they are published" — once you've
   resolved a `schema_url` to a file, it is safe to cache that resolution permanently. Fetchers
   must follow HTTP redirects. Consumers/backends MAY bundle known schema files at build time
   instead of fetching over the network at all.
4. **Versioning:** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, SemVer 2.0 ordering, and — importantly for anyone mapping
   this to semconv — **"OpenTelemetry schema version numbers match OpenTelemetry Semantic
   Conventions version numbers,"** i.e. schema `1.27.0` corresponds to semconv `1.27.0`.

`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/schemas/`

### Schema file format (1.1.0)

A schema file is YAML:

```yaml
file_format: 1.1.0
schema_url: /schemas/1.2.0
versions:
    1.2.0:
        all:
            changes: [...]
        resources:
            changes: [...]
        spans:
            changes: [...]
        span_events:
            changes: [...]
        metrics:
            changes: [...]
        logs:
            changes: [...]
```

- `file_format` must literally be `"1.1.0"`.
- `schema_url`'s trailing version must equal the highest version key present under `versions`.
- The **`all`** section's transforms apply first, to every signal type; then per-signal sections
  apply on top.
- Transformations are **intentionally minimal by design** ("we intentionally limit the types of
  transformations of schemas to the bare minimum") — this is not a general ETL DSL.

Transform types by section, per the 1.1.0 format:

| Section       | Supported transforms                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `all`         | `rename_attributes`                            |
| `resources`   | `rename_attributes`                            |
| `spans`       | `rename_attributes`                            |
| `span_events` | `rename_events`, `rename_attributes`           |
| `metrics`     | `rename_metrics`, `rename_attributes`, `split` |
| `logs`        | `rename_attributes`                            |

`rename_attributes` — the one most relevant to Maple's existing manual coalescing — takes an
`attribute_map` of old→new names, optionally scoped to specific span names / event names / metric
names via `apply_to_spans` / `apply_to_events` / `apply_to_metrics`:

```yaml
- rename_attributes:
      attribute_map:
          old_name: new_name
      apply_to_spans: [span_name]
      apply_to_events: [event_name]
      apply_to_metrics: [metric_name]
```

`rename_metrics` renames a metric name outright; `split` breaks one metric into several by an
attribute's value (e.g. `system.paging.operations` split by `direction` into
`system.paging.operations.in` / `.out`).

Version 1.1.0's change versus 1.0.0 was introducing this structured, declarative transform
framework so tooling can walk a chain of schema versions and apply/reverse the diffs
automatically, rather than each consumer hand-rolling migrations.
`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/schemas/file_format_v1.1.0/`

### Applying transformations (the pattern Maple's manual coalescing approximates)

Two implementation patterns the spec describes:

1. **Schema-aware backend:** compare the `schema_url` on incoming data against the schema
   version the backend wants; walk the schema file's declared changes between those versions;
   apply them (e.g., the spec's own example — renaming `deployment.environment` to
   `environment`). This is precisely the shape of the `deployment.environment` →
   `deployment.environment.name` rename Maple's `apps/ingest` currently handles by **dual-emitting
   both keys** (per CLAUDE.md) rather than by reading `schema_url` and transforming — i.e. we're
   doing the outcome without the mechanism.
2. **Collector-Assisted Schema Transformation:** delegate the conversion to an OpenTelemetry
   Collector's Schema Translate Processor sitting in the pipeline, so producers/consumers never
   need schema logic themselves.

`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/schemas/`

**Note for Maple:** we do not currently read `schema_url` from ingested `ResourceSpans` /
`ResourceMetrics` / `ResourceLogs` anywhere in the ingest gateway or collector config (verify
against `apps/ingest` if this needs to be load-bearing) — the legacy-field coalescing described in
CLAUDE.md (`db.statement*`/`db.system` ↔ `db.query.text`/`db.system.name`,
`deployment.environment` ↔ `deployment.environment.name`) is hand-written per-field logic, not
schema-driven. If schema-aware coalescing is ever generalized, this is the mechanism to build on.

## 3. Prometheus & OpenMetrics compatibility

### Status

**Stable**, with two carve-outs the spec itself marks **Development**: resource-attribute →
`target_info`/`job`/`instance` handling, and Prometheus "Unknown"-type metric handling.
`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/compatibility/prometheus_and_openmetrics/`

### OTLP → Prometheus naming rules

- **Unit suffixes:** UCUM units are mapped to Prometheus unit words via a lookup table (`By` →
  `bytes`, `ms` → `milliseconds`, etc.); bracketed annotations like `{packet}` are dropped; units
  expressed as rates (`m/s`) become `_per_` words (`meters_per_second`). The resulting unit
  **SHOULD** also be set as OpenMetrics `UNIT` metadata. A unit suffix **SHOULD** be appended to
  the metric name unless the name already ends with it (before any type suffix).
- **`_total` suffix:** for monotonic Sum points, a `_total` suffix **SHOULD** be added by default
  if not already present; if already present, the name **MUST** stay unchanged (no double
  suffixing).
- **Character sanitization:** characters Prometheus discourages in metric names **SHOULD** be
  replaced with `_` by default, and repeated `_` collapsed to one.
- **Resource attributes → `job`/`instance`/`target_info`:** `service.namespace` +
  `service.name` **MUST** combine into `<namespace>/<name>` (or just `<name>` if no namespace) to
  form the `job` label; `service.instance.id`, if present, **MUST** become the `instance` label
  (else `instance` is emitted empty). Other resource attributes **SHOULD** become a synthetic
  `target_info` metric (an OpenMetrics "info" metric, or — if the client library lacks info-metric
  support — a gauge named `target_info` with constant value `1`) or **MUST** be dropped.
  _(Development status.)_
- **Untyped/Gauge round-trip:** exporting an OTLP Gauge back toward Prometheus, if the datapoint
  carries a `prometheus.type` attribute equal to `unknown`, it **MUST** become a Prometheus
  Unknown-typed sample. _(Development status.)_

### Prometheus → OTLP naming rules

- By default, label keys/values **MUST NOT** be altered (e.g., no automatic `_`→`.` translation)
  — the opposite direction is lossier/more speculative than OTLP→Prom, so the spec is
  conservative here.
- `UNIT` metadata, if present on the Prometheus side, **MUST** be converted into the OTLP metric's
  unit.
- A Prometheus **Unknown**-typed metric **MUST** be converted to an **OTLP Gauge** on ingest.
  _(Development status.)_
- Summary quantiles carry a `quantile` label with the stringified float (e.g. `0.99`); histogram
  buckets use Prometheus's standard `le` (less-than-or-equal) label — the spec does not add new
  bucket-naming rules beyond these Prometheus/OpenMetrics conventions.

`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/compatibility/prometheus_and_openmetrics/`

---

## 4. OpenCensus compatibility (shim)

### Status

**Deprecated** as of **June 2026**; removal not before **June 2027**. Existing shims MAY keep
being supported, but implementing new OpenCensus compatibility is explicitly not required by the
spec going forward. `Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/compatibility/opencensus/`

### What it guarantees / why customer data may show OpenCensus artifacts

The shim implements the OpenCensus Trace API and a Stats/Metrics bridge (`OpenCensus-Metrics-Shim`
implementing `MetricProducer`) on top of OpenTelemetry, so legacy OpenCensus instrumentation can
keep running unmodified while everything around it moves to OTel. It guarantees parent/child span
relationships and span **Links** survive translation, and both push/pull metric exporters keep
working, covering Gauges, Counters, Cumulative Histograms, and Summaries. The reason a Maple
customer's data could carry OpenCensus fingerprints is the well-known **"OpenTelemetry
sandwich"**: outer application layers adopt OTel first while inner dependencies are still on
OpenCensus, and the shim bridges the two until migration completes.
`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/compatibility/opencensus/`

---

## 5. OpenTracing compatibility (shim)

### Status

**Deprecated** as of **March 2026**; removal not before **March 2027**. Same posture as
OpenCensus above — existing shims MAY continue, new implementation isn't required.
`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/compatibility/opentracing/`

### What it guarantees / span kind & reference mapping

The shim implements the OpenTracing API as a bridge over the OpenTelemetry API/SDK, without
exposing OTel internals to OpenTracing-instrumented code. The part most likely to surface as an
artifact in ingested data: OpenTracing's two **Reference** types (`Child Of`, `Follows From`)
become OpenTelemetry **Links**, with the original reference type preserved as an
**`opentracing.ref_type`** span attribute — so seeing that attribute key in customer traces is a
tell that the data passed through this shim. The first `Child Of` reference (or the first
reference of any kind if none is `Child Of`) is chosen as the span's actual OTel parent; Baggage
from referenced spans is merged into the new span's initial Baggage.

**Known limitation called out by the spec:** mixing the OpenTracing shim and the native
OpenTelemetry API in the same process risks broken Baggage propagation, because OpenTelemetry has
no awareness of the shim's association between a shim span and its Baggage; in languages with
implicit context propagation (e.g. JavaScript) this can also produce incorrect parent/child
relationships, violating OpenTracing's explicit-propagation-only semantics.
`Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/compatibility/opentracing/`

---

## 6. Other emerging spec-tree items (pointers)

- **Entities** — a Development-stage remodeling of the Resource concept: each signal (including
  Profiles) will be able to attach one or more typed Entities (`k8s.cluster`, `host`,
  `container`, …), each with stable identifying attributes plus mutable descriptive attributes,
  layered on top of the existing Resource attribute pool for OTLP 1.x backward compatibility.
  Not otherwise covered in this doc set — treat as a future Resource-model change to watch, not
  something to implement against yet.
  `Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/entities/data-model/`
- **Trace Context in non-OTLP Log Formats** — a compatibility spec (sibling to OpenCensus/
  OpenTracing/Prometheus above) for propagating trace context through log formats that aren't
  OTLP; noted here as a pointer since it's linked from the same compatibility index but out of
  this pass's detailed scope.
  `Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/compatibility/logging_trace_context/`
- **The Collector itself is not part of the OpenTelemetry specification.** Its docs
  (`https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector`) describe a reference
  implementation's data flow, processors, and receivers (including the `pprof` receiver and
  Schema Translate Processor mentioned above) — useful for understanding available tooling, but
  none of it is spec-mandated or spec-versioned.
