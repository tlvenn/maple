# Semantic Conventions

OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions ("semconv") define the common attribute names, span/metric naming rules, and per-domain required/recommended fields that give telemetry consistent meaning across languages, libraries, and vendors. They live in a single spec (currently **v1.43.0**) covering traces, metrics, logs, resources, and profiles, published from `github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions` and rendered at `https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/`.

> **Relevance to Maple:** Maple is primarily a **consumer/backend** for OTel data — our ClickHouse/Tinybird schemas, dashboard UI, and query engine all key on semconv attribute names, so drift between "what the spec says" and "what our ingest/query layers expect" causes silent breakage (missing facets, wrong span-status coloring, unmatched filters). Our trace UI keys on `http.request.method`/`http.route`/`http.response.status_code`; our Rust ingest gateway (`apps/ingest`) emits new-semconv HTTP attributes and self-instruments per `service.name="ingest"` (see root `CLAUDE.md`); warehouse read paths alias legacy `db.statement`/`db.system` to `db.query.text`/`db.system.name` for spans recorded before the DB semconv stability migration; and per project convention our own span status values use **title case** (`"Ok"`, `"Error"`, `"Unset"`), matching the OTel API enum names rather than the lowercase wire values some SDKs historically emitted.

## General rules

### Attribute naming

Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/naming/

- "Names SHOULD be lowercase" and use **namespacing**, delimited by a dot character (e.g. `http.response.status_code` is the `status_code` attribute in the `http` namespace, itself nested under `http.response`).
- Multi-word components within a dot-delimited segment use **snake_case** (`status_code`, not `statusCode` or `status-code`).
- Character rules: names must be a valid Unicode sequence restricted to printable Basic Latin; tooling further limits to lowercase Latin letters, digits, underscore, and dot; names **must start with a letter, end with an alphanumeric character**, and must not contain two or more consecutive delimiters.
- Pluralization: singular for single-valued attributes (`host.name`), plural for array-valued attributes (`process.command_args`).
- Custom/vendor attributes outside the registry should be namespaced under a reverse-DNS-style prefix (e.g. `com.acme.shopname.*`) to avoid collisions with future registry additions.
- Metric names additionally: namespaces and metric names generally **SHOULD NOT be pluralized** (`system.process.count`, not `system.processes`); counters/up-down counters **SHOULD NOT** append `_total`; units follow UCUM (Unified Code for Units of Measure), preferring un-prefixed units (`By` not `MiBy`) and `s` for durations, with bracketed annotations matching grammatical number (`{request}` not `{requests}`).

### Attribute requirement levels

Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/

| Level                      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Required**               | "All instrumentations MUST populate the attribute." Expected to be efficiently available in the vast majority of cases.                                                                   |
| **Conditionally Required** | "All instrumentations MUST populate the attribute when the given condition is satisfied." The convention must spell out the triggering condition.                                         |
| **Recommended**            | "Instrumentations SHOULD add the attribute by default if it's readily available and can be efficiently populated." May be disabled for perf/security/privacy reasons.                     |
| **Opt-In**                 | "Instrumentations SHOULD populate the attribute if and only if the user configures the instrumentation to do so." Reserved for expensive-to-collect or privacy/security-sensitive fields. |

### Span naming

Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/ (core span-naming rule, part of the tracing API spec that semconv domains implement against)

- "The span name SHOULD be the most general string that identifies a (statistically) interesting class of Spans, rather than individual Span instances" — i.e. **low cardinality is mandatory**. `get_user` is a good name; `get_user/314159` (embedding a user ID) is not.
- Generality is prioritized over human-readability when the two conflict.
- Each domain gives its own concrete template (e.g. HTTP: `{method} {route}`; DB: `{db.query.summary}` or `{db.operation.name} {target}`; see domain sections below) — always built from low-cardinality attribute values, never from raw high-cardinality identifiers (full URLs, raw SQL literals, IDs).

### Recording errors / span status

Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/recording-errors/

- "Span Status Code MUST be left unset if the instrumented operation has ended without any errors." Only set `Error` on genuine failures.
- When an operation fails: set span status to `Error` and set `error.type`; an optional status description can add detail but shouldn't just repeat the status code or error type.
- `error.type` must be applied **consistently** between a span and its corresponding metric for the same operation: same value if failed, absent if succeeded.
- Errors that were retried/handled internally (the operation still completes successfully) **SHOULD NOT** be recorded as errors on the span/metric describing that operation.

### Stability levels

Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/versioning-and-stability/

OpenTelemetry signals (including semconv domains) move through a lifecycle:

| Level           | Meaning                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Development** | May have breaking changes; "Long-term dependencies SHOULD NOT be taken against signals in Development."                                         |
| **Stable**      | Backward compatibility guaranteed; safe to build long-term dependencies against.                                                                |
| **Deprecated**  | Being phased out; "Signals MUST NOT be marked as deprecated unless the replacement is stable." Same support guarantees as stable until removed. |
| **Removed**     | No longer supported; removal requires a major version bump.                                                                                     |

Per-domain stability (see each section below): **HTTP is Stable**; **Database is Stable** (as of the v1.30-era stability migration); **Messaging is Development**; **RPC is Release Candidate**; **Exceptions**-as-span-events is **Deprecated** in favor of exceptions-on-logs; **Code attributes are Stable**; **General attributes (`server.*`, `client.*`, `network.*`, `url.*`) are Stable** (a handful of derived `url.*` sub-attributes remain Development); **Gen-AI is Development** and has moved to a separate spec repo.

### The `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` migration pattern

Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/non-normative/http-migration/ · https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/non-normative/db-migration/

When a domain graduates from experimental to stable, its attribute names/values often change (e.g. `http.method` → `http.request.method`). Because this breaks dashboards/alerts built on the old names, instrumentations expose an env var so users can migrate on their own schedule instead of the instrumentation silently flipping conventions:

- **HTTP** (`OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`): `http` = emit only the new stable HTTP/network conventions; `http/dup` = emit **both** old and new (phased rollout); unset/default = keep emitting whatever the instrumentation emitted before.
- **Database**: same three-way shape with values `database` / `database/dup` / default.
- **Gen-AI**: `gen_ai_latest_experimental` opts into the newest experimental gen-ai shape instead of the pre-1.36.0 one; default keeps emitting whatever version was previously emitted.
- Constraint: this variable is "only intended to be used when migrating from an experimental semantic convention to its initial stable version" — not a general-purpose versioning knob. Instrumentations must support the `/dup` dual-emit mode for **at least six months** after introducing it, within their current major version, before dropping the old shape in a subsequent major version.
- Exceptions have an analogous but distinct variable, `OTEL_SEMCONV_EXCEPTION_SIGNAL_OPT_IN` (`logs` / `logs/dup` / default) — see the Exceptions section.

### Schema URLs & telemetry schemas

Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/schemas/

- A **Schema URL** identifies a specific version of a telemetry schema and is the address from which the schema file can be fetched: `http[s]://server[:port]/path/<version>`. The portion before the version is the **Schema Family** identifier, stable across all versions in that family.
- OTLP carries `schema_url` at the `Resource*` message level and at the `InstrumentationScope`/instrumentation-library level; when both are present, the scope-level one takes precedence for that scope's data.
- Purpose: semantic conventions evolve (attributes get renamed, e.g. `http.method` → `http.request.method`, or `deployment.environment` → `deployment.environment.name`); a schema file formally declares the transformation rules needed to convert telemetry between schema versions, so a consumer that knows the schema version of incoming data (via `schema_url`) can mechanically rewrite it to the version its dashboards/alerts expect, instead of every consumer hand-rolling compatibility shims.
- The schema file format itself is versioned separately (`file_format_v1.0.0`, `file_format_v1.1.0`) from the schema content it describes.

### The semconv registry

Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/registry/attributes/ · https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions

- The **attribute registry** (`/docs/specs/semconv/registry/attributes/`) is an auto-generated, searchable/browsable catalog of every registered attribute, organized by namespace (`http.*`, `db.*`, `network.*`, `code.*`, …), each with type, stability, and description — this is the fastest way to check an attribute's current name/stability without reading the full domain spec.
- The registry and all domain specs are generated from YAML model definitions in `github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions` (the source of truth); the rendered docs on opentelemetry.io are a build artifact of that repo. Gen-AI conventions have since split out into their own sibling repo, `github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-genai` (see Gen-AI section).

---

## HTTP

**Stability: Stable** (both client and server spans/metrics).
Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-spans/ · https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-metrics/

### Span name

`{method} {target}` when a low-cardinality target is known, else just `{method}`. `{method}` is `http.request.method` if known, else the literal string `HTTP`. Server spans use `http.route` as `{target}`; client spans may use `url.template`. **"Instrumentation MUST NOT default to using URI path as a `{target}`"** (path segments are high-cardinality).

### Required / Conditionally Required attributes

| Attribute                   | Level          | Client / Server | Notes                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `http.request.method`       | Required       | Both            | GET, POST, HEAD, …                                                     |
| `server.address`            | Required       | Client          | Domain/IP/socket the request targets                                   |
| `server.port`               | Required       | Client          | —                                                                      |
| `url.full`                  | Required       | Client          | Absolute URL, RFC3986; credentials MUST be redacted                    |
| `url.path`                  | Required       | Server          | URI path component                                                     |
| `url.scheme`                | Required       | Server          | `http`/`https`                                                         |
| `http.response.status_code` | Cond. Required | Both            | If a response was received/sent                                        |
| `error.type`                | Cond. Required | Both            | If the request ended in error                                          |
| `network.protocol.name`     | Cond. Required | Both            | If not `http` and version is set                                       |
| `http.route`                | Cond. Required | Server          | If available; must be low-cardinality (static segments + placeholders) |
| `server.port`               | Cond. Required | Server          | If available and `server.address` set                                  |
| `url.query`                 | Cond. Required | Server          | If a query string was present                                          |

### Span status mapping (the important compliance rule)

- **1xx/2xx/3xx**: leave span status **unset**, unless another error occurred (network failure, redirect-limit exceeded) — then `Error`.
- **4xx**: **SERVER** spans leave status **unset** (client errors aren't the server's fault); **CLIENT** spans **SHOULD** be set to `Error`.
- **5xx**: `Error` for **both** client and server spans, plus `error.type` set.
- Intentionally cancelled client requests (caller-initiated) should **not** be treated as errors.

This asymmetry (4xx = Ok for SERVER, Error for CLIENT) is the single most load-bearing rule for anyone building error-rate dashboards — filtering `StatusCode = 'Error'` on server spans will correctly exclude client 4xx noise, but the same filter on client spans will correctly include it.

### Retries/resends

Each client resend (redirect, auth failure, 5xx, network error — cause doesn't matter) increments `http.request.resend_count`, set to the ordinal number of the resend attempt.

### Metrics (Stable)

| Metric                                              | Type          | Unit        | Stability   | Required attrs                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `http.server.request.duration`                      | Histogram     | `s`         | Stable      | `http.request.method`, `url.scheme`                    |
| `http.client.request.duration`                      | Histogram     | `s`         | Stable      | `http.request.method`, `server.address`, `server.port` |
| `http.server.active_requests`                       | UpDownCounter | `{request}` | Development | Opt-in                                                 |
| `http.{server,client}.{request,response}.body.size` | Histogram     | `By`        | Development | Opt-in                                                 |

When reported alongside a span, the duration metric value **SHOULD** equal the span's duration.

> **Maple hook:** our trace UI keys directly on `http.request.method` / `http.route` / `http.response.status_code`; the SERVER-4xx-is-Ok rule above is exactly what our error-rate widgets assume when they filter on span status.

---

## Database

**Stability: Stable** (as of the DB semconv stability migration; pre-migration instrumentations used `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN=database`/`database/dup` to move over — see General rules above).
Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/db/database-spans/ · https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/db/database-metrics/ · https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/non-normative/db-migration/

The stable migration renamed `db.system` → `db.system.name` (and `db.statement` → `db.query.text`), and changed many enum values to a `<vendor>.<product>` pattern.

### Span name

Priority order:

1. `{db.query.summary}` if available
2. `{db.operation.name} {target}` if a low-cardinality operation name is available
3. `{target}` alone
4. `{db.system.name}` as the final fallback

Where `{target}` prefers, in order: `db.collection.name` → `db.stored_procedure.name` → `db.namespace` → `server.address:server.port`.

### Required / Conditionally Required attributes

| Attribute                 | Level          | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `db.system.name`          | Required       | DBMS product identifier (e.g. `postgresql`, `clickhouse`)          |
| `db.collection.name`      | Cond. Required | If readily available and the operation targets a single collection |
| `db.namespace`            | Cond. Required | If available                                                       |
| `db.operation.name`       | Cond. Required | If readily available and describes a single operation              |
| `db.response.status_code` | Cond. Required | If the operation failed and a code is available                    |
| `error.type`              | Cond. Required | If and only if the operation failed                                |
| `server.port`             | Cond. Required | If a non-default port is used and `server.address` is set          |

### `db.query.text` sanitization

- Raw (non-parameterized) query text should only be collected **if sanitized to exclude sensitive info** — literals replaced with a placeholder (e.g. `?`).
- **"Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized."** Using parameters is itself a strong signal from the application that sensitive values are passed out-of-band as parameters, not embedded in the query text.
- IN-clauses may be collapsed for cardinality control (`IN (?, ?, ?, ?)` → `IN (?)`).

### Span status

Follows the general Recording Errors doc; each system-specific DB convention should specify which `db.response.status_code` values count as errors.

### Metrics

| Metric                                                                              | Type                            | Unit    | Stability   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `db.client.operation.duration`                                                      | Histogram                       | `s`     | **Stable**  |
| `db.client.response.returned_rows`                                                  | Histogram                       | `{row}` | Development |
| `db.client.connection.*` (pool size, idle, pending, timeouts, create/wait/use time) | Counter/UpDownCounter/Histogram | varies  | Development |

Batch operations **SHOULD** be recorded as a single operation (not one metric event per row/statement).

> **Maple hook:** warehouse read paths in `WarehouseQueryService` coalesce both the legacy (`db.statement`, `db.system`) and stable (`db.query.text`, `db.system.name`) spellings, since spans recorded before our own migration still carry the legacy names — mirrors exactly the dual-emit window the spec expects instrumentations to support.

---

## Messaging

**Stability: Development** (not yet stable — per the spec, existing instrumentations on v1.24.0-era conventions should not change what they emit by default until this stabilizes).
Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/messaging/messaging-spans/

### Span name

`{messaging.operation.name} {destination}`, where `{destination}` prefers `messaging.destination.template` (low-cardinality template) → `messaging.destination.name` (for known, non-temporary destinations) → `server.address:server.port` (only when no specific destination is targeted).

### Required / Conditionally Required attributes

| Attribute                       | Level          | Notes                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `messaging.system`              | Required       | e.g. `kafka`, `rabbitmq`, `aws_sqs`                           |
| `messaging.operation.name`      | Required       | System-specific operation name (`send`, `publish`, `poll`, …) |
| `messaging.operation.type`      | Cond. Required | One of `create`/`send`/`receive`/`process`/`settle`           |
| `messaging.destination.name`    | Cond. Required | Single-message ops, or batch ops with a uniform destination   |
| `messaging.batch.message_count` | Cond. Required | Batch operations                                              |
| `messaging.consumer.group.name` | Cond. Required | If applicable to the system                                   |
| `error.type`                    | Cond. Required | If the operation failed                                       |

### Span kind by operation type

| Operation | Span kind                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `create`  | PRODUCER                                            |
| `send`    | PRODUCER (if the created context is used) or CLIENT |
| `receive` | CLIENT                                              |
| `process` | CONSUMER                                            |
| `settle`  | CLIENT                                              |

Status follows the general Recording Errors doc; don't set `error.type` on success.

---

## RPC

**Stability: Release Candidate** (near-stable; minor changes possible before final release).
Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/rpc/rpc-spans/

### Span name

`{rpc.method}` if known and not `_OTHER`; else falls back to `{rpc.system.name}`.

### Required / Conditionally Required attributes

## Exceptions

**Stability: the span-event form is Deprecated; the log-record form is the current Stable recommendation.**
Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/exceptions/exceptions-spans/ · https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/exceptions/exceptions-logs/

- Recording exceptions as **span events** (event name `exception`) is deprecated: "Use Semantic conventions for exceptions in logs instead." `exception.escaped` is likewise deprecated — "It's no longer recommended to record exceptions that are handled and do not escape the scope of a span."
- The current guidance: exceptions **SHOULD be recorded as attributes on the LogRecord** passed to `Logger` emit operations, not as span events.
- Migration is gated by `OTEL_SEMCONV_EXCEPTION_SIGNAL_OPT_IN`: `logs` = emit as logs only; `logs/dup` = emit both span events and logs during a phased rollout; default = keep emitting span events. Even after an instrumentation moves to logs-only emission, "users will still have the option to route those to span events at the SDK layer."
- Attributes (same names/semantics in both forms):

| Attribute              | Level          | Notes                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exception.type`       | Cond. Required | Fully-qualified exception class name; required if `exception.message` unset |
| `exception.message`    | Cond. Required | Required if `exception.type` unset; may contain sensitive data              |
| `exception.stacktrace` | Recommended    | Natural stack-trace string for the language runtime                         |

- Instrumentations **should not** record artificial/synthetic exceptions manufactured by a framework purely to represent an error status code.

## Code

**Stability: Stable.**
Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/registry/attributes/code/ · https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/non-normative/code-attrs-migration/

| Attribute            | Description                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code.function.name` | Fully-qualified function/method name **without arguments**, in the natural representation for the language runtime   |
| `code.file.path`     | Source file identifying the code unit as uniquely as possible (prefer absolute path)                                 |
| `code.line.number`   | Line in `code.file.path` best representing the operation; should point within the unit named by `code.function.name` |
| `code.column.number` | Column in `code.file.path`, same "should point within" constraint                                                    |
| `code.stacktrace`    | Stack trace string in the language's natural representation; identical semantics to `exception.stacktrace`           |

Note: as of the v1.29.0 → v1.33.0 migration, the older separate `code.namespace` and `code.function` attributes were folded into the single `code.function.name` (which now carries the fully-qualified name). All `code.*` attributes are disallowed on Profile signals (redundant with data profiling already captures).

## Network, URL, Server, Client (general attributes)

**Stability: Stable** for the attributes below (a few derived `url.*` sub-attributes are still Development, noted inline).
Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/registry/attributes/network/ · https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/registry/attributes/url/ · general attribute registry

### `server.*` / `client.*`

| Attribute        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `server.address` | Server domain name if resolvable without a reverse DNS lookup, else IP/socket. When observed client-side through an intermediary (proxy), **SHOULD** represent the real server behind it, if known |
| `server.port`    | Server port; same "behind the intermediary" preference as `server.address`                                                                                                                         |
| `client.address` | Client address as observed by the server (may itself be a proxy)                                                                                                                                   |
| `client.port`    | Client port as observed by the server                                                                                                                                                              |

### `network.*`

| Attribute                                      | Description                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `network.protocol.name`                        | OSI application layer or non-OSI equivalent (e.g. `http`, `amqp`); lowercase-normalized |
| `network.protocol.version`                     | Actual (post-negotiation) protocol version in use                                       |
| `network.transport`                            | OSI transport layer / IPC method; lowercase-normalized                                  |
| `network.type`                                 | OSI network layer or non-OSI equivalent; lowercase-normalized                           |
| `network.peer.address` / `network.peer.port`   | Peer (remote) address/port of the connection                                            |
| `network.local.address` / `network.local.port` | Local address/port of the connection                                                    |
| `network.io.direction`                         | `transmit`/`receive`, from the observing host's perspective (Release Candidate)         |

Guidance: "Consider always setting the transport when setting a port number, since a port number is ambiguous without knowing the transport."

### `url.*`

| Attribute                                                                                                   | Stability   | Description                                                                                                                                           |

## Gen-AI

**Stability: Development.** Note: gen-ai semantic conventions **moved out of the main spec** into a dedicated repository, `github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-genai` (the `opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/` pages now redirect/point there).
Source: https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-genai/blob/main/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md

### Span name

- Inference spans: `{gen_ai.operation.name} {gen_ai.request.model}`
- Retrieval spans: `{gen_ai.operation.name} {gen_ai.data_source.id}`
- Individual GenAI systems/frameworks may define their own span-name format.

### Required / Conditionally Required attributes

| Attribute                    | Level          | Notes                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `gen_ai.operation.name`      | Required       | e.g. `chat`, `embeddings`, `retrieval`                                                                       |
| `gen_ai.provider.name`       | Required       | Provider identifier, e.g. `openai`, `anthropic`, `gcp.vertex_ai` (supersedes the deprecated `gen_ai.system`) |
| `gen_ai.request.model`       | Cond. Required | If available                                                                                                 |
| `gen_ai.response.model`      | Cond. Required | If available; the actual model that served the response (may differ from the requested one)                  |
| `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`  | Recommended    | —                                                                                                            |
| `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` | Recommended    | —                                                                                                            |
| `error.type`                 | Cond. Required | Should match the provider's/client library's error code                                                      |

Span kinds covered by the spec include Inference, Embeddings, Retrieval, Memory, and Execute-Tool spans. Migration is gated by `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN=gen_ai_latest_experimental` (opt into the newest experimental shape) vs. default (keep emitting whatever pre-1.36.0 shape was already in use) — the spec notes this transition plan will gain a genuine stable value once gen-ai conventions themselves stabilize.

> **Maple hook:** relevant to our AI features — treat `gen_ai.*` as Development/pre-stable, expect attribute churn (`gen_ai.system` → `gen_ai.provider.name` already happened), and don't hard-code assumptions about the current attribute set without checking the genai repo for the version in use.
