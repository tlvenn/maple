# Tracing (API & SDK)

This page documents the OpenTelemetry **Tracing** specification: the Trace API (`TracerProvider`,
`Tracer`, `Span`, `SpanContext`), the Trace SDK (samplers, span processors, span limits, ID
generators, the `SpanExporter` interface), and the normative rules a spec-compliant tracing
implementation (or a backend that consumes its output) must honor. Every claim below is sourced
from the official specification — see inline `Source:` links — and each section states the
stability level the spec itself declares (Stable / Development / Deprecated), because normative
strength differs materially by level (only Stable sections are locked against breaking change).

## Relevance to Maple

> Maple is primarily a **consumer/backend** of OTel trace data (Rust `apps/ingest` OTLP gateway →
> collector → ClickHouse/Tinybird → web dashboard), plus a **self-instrumented emitter** of its own
> traces (`@effect/opentelemetry` in the API/alerting/chat-agent workers, and `apps/ingest`'s own
> Rust OTLP self-instrumentation — see CLAUDE.md "Self-Observability"). Both angles are why this
> spec matters:
>
> - **As a consumer/backend:** we must defensively parse whatever a compliant (or non-compliant)
>   SDK emits. Key invariants to enforce or tolerate: `TraceId`/`SpanId` validity (all-zero = invalid,
>   §[SpanContext](#spancontext)), the `Sampled`/`IsRecording` combination that must never reach us
>   (`Sampled=true, IsRecording=false` is spec-forbidden — §[Sampling](#sampling-sdk)), `StatusCode`
>   ordering (`Ok > Error > Unset`, and `Description` is only meaningful on `Error` —
>   §[Status](#set-status)), and the 5 `SpanKind` values that drive our service-map/flamegraph
>   parent-child inference (§[SpanKind](#spankind)). Maple stores span status as title-case
>   `"Ok"`/`"Error"`/`"Unset"` strings (see CLAUDE.md "Data Conventions"), which matches the spec's
>   enum spelling directly — but the OTLP wire encoding uses a different, uppercase enum
>   (`STATUS_CODE_OK` / `STATUS_CODE_ERROR` / `STATUS_CODE_UNSET`); our ingest/collector mapping
>   layer is the one place that translation must stay correct.
> - **As a self-instrumented emitter:** our own services configure `BatchSpanProcessor` knobs,
>   samplers (`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` / `_ARG`), and span limits via the env vars in
>   §[Span Limits](#span-limits) and §[Span Processor](#span-processor-sdk). The
>   `withTracerDisabledWhen` health-check filter and the `workerd` monotonic-clock timestamp bug
>   (see MEMORY.md) are both examples of us needing to reason precisely about `Span` start/end
>   timestamp semantics (§[Span](#span)) and `OnStart`/`OnEnd` processor timing
>   (§[Span Processor](#span-processor-sdk)).
> - **Links added after span start** (§[Add Link](#add-link)) and **attributes preferred at
>   creation** (§[Span Creation](#span-creation)) matter for our own instrumentation code review:
>   sampling can only ever see what was present at span-start time.

## 1. Scope and stability

**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/ ,
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/

Both the Trace API spec and the Trace SDK spec carry the document-level banner:

> "**Status**: Stable, except where otherwise specified"

This means: unless a specific subsection is explicitly marked otherwise, treat it as **Stable**
(locked against breaking changes). A number of subsections — mostly newer extension points — are
explicitly marked **Development** (pre-release, can still change) inline; these are called out
throughout this doc. `TraceIdRatioBased`'s _configuration/creation_ API is Stable, but its
_algorithm_ compatibility is separately flagged (see §[Samplers](#samplers)). No section in either
document is marked **Experimental** or **Deprecated** at time of writing (2026), though
`TraceIdRatioBased` is textually described as "deprecated in favor of" `ProbabilitySampler` (a
**Development**-status component) — see §[Samplers](#samplers) for the exact deprecation timeline
language.

## 2. SpanContext

**Stability: Stable.**
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#spancontext

A `SpanContext` is the serializable portion of a `Span` — the part that must be propagated across
process boundaries. `SpanContext`s are **immutable**. The representation conforms to the
[W3C TraceContext spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/).

| Field        | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TraceId`    | 16-byte array; **valid** iff it has at least one non-zero byte (all-zero = invalid)                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `SpanId`     | 8-byte array; **valid** iff it has at least one non-zero byte (all-zero = invalid)                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `TraceFlags` | Present on every span context (unlike `TraceState`). Currently defines two flags: `Sampled` ([W3C sampled flag](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#sampled-flag)) and `Random` ([W3C random-trace-id flag](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#random-trace-id-flag)) |
| `TraceState` | List of tracing-system-specific key-value pairs; lets multiple tracing systems co-participate in one trace; fully defined by [W3C `tracestate`](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#tracestate-header)                                                                    |
| `IsRemote`   | Boolean — was this `SpanContext` received from another process, or locally generated?                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Normative rules:

- The API **MUST** implement methods to create a `SpanContext`, and these **SHOULD** be the only
  way to create one; this "MUST be fully implemented in the API, and SHOULD NOT be overridable."
- **Retrieving TraceId/SpanId:** the API **MUST** allow retrieval in hex (32-hex-char lowercase
  string for `TraceId`, 16-hex-char lowercase for `SpanId`) and binary (16-byte / 8-byte array)
  forms. The API **SHOULD NOT** expose how they are stored internally.
- **`IsValid`**: "MUST be provided," returns `true` iff both `TraceId` and `SpanId` are non-zero.
- **`IsRemote`**: "MUST be provided." When a `SpanContext` is extracted via the Propagators API,
  `IsRemote` **MUST** return `true`; for any child span's own context it **MUST** return `false`.
- **`TraceState` operations** — the API **MUST** provide: get value for key, add key-value pair,
  update existing value, delete pair. All mutating operations **MUST** return a new immutable
  `TraceState`; all must validate their inputs and **MUST NOT** return a `TraceState` containing
  invalid data on invalid input (follow "general error handling guidelines" instead). Because
  `SpanContext` is immutable, a new `TraceState` can only take effect at
  [propagation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/context/api-propagators/) or
  [export](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/#span-exporter) time — propagators
  and exporters may create a modified copy right before serializing to the wire.

## 3. Span

**Stability: Stable** (see §[Span Creation](#span-creation) for one Development-status nuance
inherited from the SDK's `TracerConfig`).
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#span

A `Span` represents a single operation within a trace; spans nest into a trace tree with one root
span per trace. A `Span` encapsulates: name, an immutable `SpanContext`, a parent (`Span` /
`SpanContext` / null), `SpanKind`, start/end timestamps, `Attributes`, a list of `Link`s, a list of
timestamped `Event`s, and a `Status`.

**Span name:** "the most general string that identifies a (statistically) interesting _class of
Spans_" rather than a per-instance identifier — generality is prioritized over human-readability
(e.g. `get_account` is good; `get_account/42` is not, due to cardinality; `get_account/{accountId}`
is also acceptable using the HTTP-route form).

**Timestamps:** "A `Span`'s start and end timestamps reflect the elapsed real time of the
operation." Start time **SHOULD** default to span-creation time. After creation it **SHOULD** be
possible to change the name, set attributes, add events, and set status — but none of these
**MUST** be changed after the end timestamp has been set.

**Isolation from application logic:** Spans are not meant to propagate information within a
process; implementations **SHOULD NOT** expose a `Span`'s own attributes/events/etc. back to the
user (only its `SpanContext` is retrievable). Vendors may implement `Span` for vendor-specific
logic, but alternative implementations **MUST NOT** allow callers to create `Span`s directly — all
`Span`s **MUST** be created via a `Tracer`.

### Span Creation

**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#span-creation

- There **MUST NOT** be any API for creating a `Span` other than via a `Tracer`.
- In languages with implicit context propagation, span creation **MUST NOT** set the new span as
  the active span in the current `Context` by default (MAY be offered as a separate operation).
- Required/accepted parameters:
    - **Name** — required.
    - **Parent `Context`** or an explicit "root span" indication. The API **MUST NOT** accept a
      `Span` or `SpanContext` directly as parent — only a full `Context`. (See
      [Determining the Parent Span from a Context](#determining-the-parent-span-from-a-context).)
    - **`SpanKind`** — defaults to `SpanKind.Internal` if unspecified.
    - **`Attributes`** — empty collection assumed if not given. "The API documentation MUST state
      that adding attributes at span creation is preferred to calling `SetAttribute` later, as
      samplers can only consider information already present during span creation."
    - **`Link`s** — an ordered sequence, see §[Link](#link).
    - **Start timestamp** — defaults to current time; "SHOULD only be set when span creation time
      has already passed" (i.e. don't pass "now" explicitly).
- Root spans: "Implementations MUST provide an option to create a `Span` as a root span, and MUST
  generate a new `TraceId` for each root span created." For a non-root span, `TraceId` **MUST**
  match the parent's, and the child **MUST** inherit all of the parent's `TraceState` values by
  default.
- A `Span` is said to have a **remote parent** if it's a child of a span created in another
  process; each propagator's deserialization must set `IsRemote=true` on that parent `SpanContext`.
- "Any span that is created MUST also be ended. This is the responsibility of the user." (Failing
  to end a span MAY leak memory/resources in the implementation.)

#### Determining the Parent Span from a Context

If the input `Context` contains a `Span`, that is the parent; if not, the new span is a root span.
A bare `SpanContext` cannot be set active in a `Context` directly — it must first be
[wrapped in a (non-recording) Span](#wrapping-a-spancontext-in-a-span).

#### Specifying links

"During Span creation, a user MUST have the ability to record links to other Spans" (same or
different trace). "Links added at Span creation may be considered by Samplers to make a sampling
decision" — a capability links added later do not have (see §[Add Link](#add-link)).

### Span operations

**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#span-operations

"With the exception of the function to retrieve the Span's SpanContext and `IsRecording`, none of
the below may be called after the Span is finished."

| Operation            | Key normative rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Get Context**      | MUST return the `SpanContext`; usable even after the span ends; MUST be the same value for the entire span lifetime. MAY be called `GetContext`.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **IsRecording**      | See dedicated subsection below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Set Attributes**   | MUST provide a single-attribute setter (`SetAttribute`); MAY provide a batch setter. Duplicate keys overwrite. Samplers only ever see attributes present at creation time — later changes can't affect their decision.                                                                                                            |
| **Add Events**       | MUST provide `AddEvent(name, attributes?, timestamp?)`; timestamp defaults to call time if omitted. Events SHOULD preserve recording order (may differ from timestamp order if custom timestamps are used out-of-order). An event's timestamp may legally fall before span start / after span end — no normalization is required. |
| **Add Link**         | MUST support adding links post-creation (see §[Add Link](#add-link)) — but these "may not be considered by Samplers."                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Set Status**       | See §[Set Status](#set-status).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **UpdateName**       | Changes span name post-creation; sampling behavior thereafter is implementation-defined, since samplers can't retroactively reconsider.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **End**              | See dedicated subsection below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Record Exception** | Language-specific specialization of `AddEvent` for exceptions (see below).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

#### IsRecording

"A `Span` is recording (`IsRecording` returns `true`) when the data provided to it via functions
like `SetAttributes`, `AddEvent`, `SetStatus` is captured in some form (e.g. in memory). When a
`Span` is not recording ... all this data is discarded right away." Further calls become no-ops.

Critically: **"This flag may be `true` despite the entire trace not being sampled."** This lets a
system record/process all spans locally (e.g. for SLA/SLO latency charts) while only exporting a
sampled subset to the backend — see §[Sampling](#sampling-sdk) for the full `IsRecording` ×
`Sampled` matrix.

"After a `Span` is ended, it SHOULD become non-recording and `IsRecording` SHOULD always return
`false`" (streaming implementations without local state are the one documented exception).
`IsRecording` **SHOULD NOT** take parameters and **SHOULD** be used to skip expensive attribute/event
computation when a span isn't recording. A child span's own recording state is independent of its
parent's `IsRecording` value (it's driven by the `Sampled` flag on `SpanContext` instead).
"Users of the API should only access the `IsRecording` property when instrumenting code and never
access `SampledFlag` unless used in context propagators."

#### Set Status

**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#set-status

Overrides the default `Unset` status. `Status` = `{ StatusCode, Description? }`.
`Description` **MUST** only be used with `StatusCode=Error` (an empty description is treated as
absent); it **MUST be ignored** for `Ok`/`Unset`.

| `StatusCode` | Meaning                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Unset`      | The default status.                                                                                        |
| `Ok`         | "The operation has been validated by an Application developer or Operator to have completed successfully." |
| `Error`      | The operation contains an error.                                                                           |

These "form a total order: `Ok > Error > Unset`" — setting `Ok` overrides any prior _or future_
attempt to set `Error`/`Unset`. Additional rules:

- An attempt to set `Unset` explicitly **SHOULD** be ignored.
- When Instrumentation Libraries set `Error`, the `Description` **SHOULD** be documented and
  predictable, and the decision to set `Error` at all **should only follow semantic-convention
  rules** (or the library's own published conventions if none exist for that operation).
- "Generally, Instrumentation Libraries SHOULD NOT set the status code to `Ok`, unless explicitly
  configured to do so." They **SHOULD** leave status `Unset` absent an error.
- Only **Application developers and Operators** (i.e., end-user code, not instrumentation
  libraries) are expected to set `Ok`.
- Once `Ok` is set it **SHOULD** be considered final; further changes **SHOULD** be ignored.
- "Analysis tools SHOULD respond to an `Ok` status by suppressing any errors they would otherwise
  generate" (e.g. suppressing a noisy 404-as-error).
- "Only the value of the last call will be recorded" — implementations are free to ignore earlier
  `SetStatus` calls when a later, permitted one arrives.

> **Maple note:** the spec's enum spelling (`Unset`/`Ok`/`Error`) is exactly the title-case string
> Maple stores (CLAUDE.md: "Span Status Codes: Use title case"). The OTLP wire proto uses a
> _different_, uppercase, prefixed spelling — `STATUS_CODE_UNSET` / `STATUS_CODE_OK` /
> `STATUS_CODE_ERROR` (see the
> [OTLP trace.proto `Status.StatusCode`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto)).
> The API spec explicitly notes the OTLP proto refers to `Description` as `message`. Any ingest
> mapping code translating OTLP → Maple's internal representation is the seam where this spelling
> difference must be handled once and consistently.

#### End

"Signals that the operation described by this span has now (or at the time optionally specified)
ended." Implementations **SHOULD** ignore subsequent calls to `End` or any other span method — the
span becomes non-recording once ended (streaming exceptions noted above). Other end-triggering
language sugar (e.g. Python `with`) **MUST** internally call `End` and be documented as such.

- **`End` MUST NOT affect child spans** — they may still be running and end later independently.
- **`End` MUST NOT inactivate the span in any `Context`** it's active in — an ended span remains
  usable as a parent via that context, and any Context-attachment mechanism must keep working.
- Optional parameter: explicit end timestamp; if omitted, treated as "now."
- Performance: "Expect this operation to be called in the hot path of production applications. It
  needs to be designed to complete fast, if not immediately." `End` itself **MUST NOT** perform
  blocking I/O on the calling thread, and locking should be minimized/eliminated where possible
  (downstream test/debug-only processors/exporters are explicitly out of scope for this
  requirement).

#### Record Exception

Languages that use exceptions **SHOULD** provide `RecordException` as a specialized `AddEvent` —
same requirements as `AddEvent` apply except where overridden here. The minimum required argument
**SHOULD** be just the exception object; an optional parameter for additional attributes **MUST**
be accepted if the method exists (existing conventional attributes take precedence over duplicates
supplied this way).

### Span lifetime

"Start and end time as well as Event's timestamps MUST be recorded at [the] time of ... calling of
[the] corresponding API" — i.e., timestamps reflect the moment the API call happens (or an
explicit override), not some other clock.

### Wrapping a SpanContext in a Span

The API **MUST** provide an operation wrapping a bare `SpanContext` as a `Span` (for in-process
propagation scenarios, e.g. propagator extraction). If a new type is needed for this, it **SHOULD
NOT** be publicly exposed if avoidable; if it must be, it **SHOULD** be named `NonRecordingSpan`.
Behavior:

- `GetContext` **MUST** return the wrapped `SpanContext`.
- `IsRecording` **MUST** return `false`.
- All remaining `Span` methods **MUST** be no-ops — including `End` (so, as the one exception to
  "every span must be ended," it's not required, or even useful, to end a wrapped context).

This "MUST be fully implemented in the API, and SHOULD NOT be overridable."

## 4. SpanKind

**Stability: Stable.**
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#spankind

`SpanKind` communicates two independent properties for analysis tooling: (1) outgoing-remote-call
vs. incoming-external-request, and (2) request/response vs. deferred execution. "In order for
`SpanKind` to be meaningful, callers SHOULD arrange that a single Span does not serve more than one
purpose" — e.g. a server-handling span should not double as the span for an outgoing RPC it makes;
instrumentation should start a _new_ span before injecting `SpanContext` for an outgoing call.

| `SpanKind` | Call direction | Communication style | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SERVER`   | incoming       | request/response    | Covers server-side handling of a remote request while the client awaits a response.                                                                                                              |
| `CLIENT`   | outgoing       | request/response    | Describes a request to a remote service where the client awaits a response. When propagated, a `CLIENT` span usually becomes the parent of a remote `SERVER` span.                               |
| `PRODUCER` | outgoing       | deferred execution  | Initiation/scheduling of a local or remote operation; often ends before the correlated `CONSUMER` span even starts. In batched messaging, each individual message needs its own `PRODUCER` span. |
| `CONSUMER` | incoming       | deferred execution  | Processing of an operation initiated by a producer that does not wait for the outcome.                                                                                                           |
| `INTERNAL` | (n/a)          | (n/a)               | **Default value.** An internal operation, as opposed to one with remote parents/children.                                                                                                        |

Notes: a `CLIENT` span may have a `CLIENT` child, or a `PRODUCER` may have a local `CLIENT` child —
kind describes the _edge_, not a strict alternating pattern. Technology-specific semantic
conventions document the expected kind per operation type (e.g. DB client calls use `CLIENT`; if a
DB client itself talks HTTP, the nested HTTP instrumentation creates its own nested `CLIENT` spans).

> **Maple relevance:** these 5 kinds (plus `PRODUCER`/`CONSUMER` pairing rules) drive service-map
> edge direction and any parent/child inference Maple's flamegraph or trace-topology code performs
> — a `PRODUCER` span legitimately ending before its `CONSUMER` starts is expected, not a data bug.

## 5. Link

**Stability: Stable.**
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#link ,
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#add-link

"A user MUST have the ability to record links to other `SpanContext`s. Linked `SpanContext`s can
be from the same or a different trace." A `Link` = `{ SpanContext, Attributes? }`.

- The API **MUST** provide a single-link recorder (e.g. `AddLink`) taking the target `SpanContext`
  plus optional attributes; **MAY** provide a batch-add variant.
- "Implementations SHOULD record links containing `SpanContext` with empty `TraceId` or `SpanId`
  (all zeros) as long as either the attribute set or `TraceState` is non-empty" — i.e., a link can
  legitimately carry an invalid ID pair if it's only there to smuggle attributes/tracestate.
- Order of links **SHOULD** be preserved as set.
- **Links added at span creation** are preferred and documented as such: "because head sampling
  decisions can only consider information present during span creation."
- **Links added after creation** (`AddLink` post-start) are explicitly allowed by the API — "A
  `Span` MUST have the ability to add `Link`s associated with it after its creation" — but "Links
  added after `Span` creation may not be considered by Samplers."

**Concurrency:** Links are immutable and **SHOULD** be safe for concurrent use by default (Events
are immutable and **MUST** be safe for concurrent use — a slightly stronger requirement than for
Links).

## 6. TracerProvider / Tracer

**Stability: Stable** for the core API-level operations described here; **Development** for
`TracerConfigurator`/`TracerConfig` (SDK-level dynamic enable/disable) — see
§[TracerProvider / Tracer (SDK)](#tracerprovider--tracer-sdk).
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#tracerprovider ,
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#tracer

`TracerProvider` is the API's entry point and the stateful object holding configuration. The API
**SHOULD** provide a way to set/register and access a global default instance, and implementations
**SHOULD** allow creating an arbitrary number of independent `TracerProvider` instances (e.g. for
per-dependency-injection-scope configuration).

**Get a Tracer** — `TracerProvider` **MUST** provide this. Accepted parameters:

| Param        | Required?              | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`       | required               | "SHOULD uniquely identify the instrumentation scope" (library/package/module/class name). Invalid (null/empty) input **MUST** still return a working no-op-free `Tracer`, not null/an exception — its `name` **SHOULD** be set to empty string and an invalid-input message **SHOULD** be logged. Implementations _may_ ignore `name` entirely if "named" tracers aren't supported. |
| `version`    | optional               | Instrumentation scope version, e.g. `"1.0.0"`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `schema_url` | optional, since 1.4.0  | Schema URL recorded in emitted telemetry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `attributes` | optional, since 1.13.0 | Instrumentation scope attributes to associate with emitted telemetry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Two `Tracer`s are _identical_ if all params match, _distinct_ otherwise. "Implementations MUST NOT
require users to repeatedly obtain a `Tracer` again with the same identity to pick up configuration
changes" — either the old `Tracer` picks up new config live, or it keeps working with stale config;
either is compliant as long as re-acquisition isn't _required_.

**Tracer operations:** `Tracer` **MUST** provide span creation; **SHOULD** provide an `Enabled()`
check (see §[Tracer (SDK)](#tracerprovider--tracer-sdk) for the SDK-level semantics driving its
return value) so callers can skip expensive work when tracing is off. `Enabled`'s return value can
change over time — the API **SHOULD** document that instrumentation must re-check it per span, not
cache it.

**Concurrency:** all `TracerProvider`, `Tracer`, and `Span` methods **MUST** be documented as safe
for concurrent use by default.

---

## 7. Context interaction

**Stability: Stable.**
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#context-interaction

The API **MUST** provide, against the generic
[`Context`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/context/): (1) extracting the `Span` from a
`Context`, (2) combining a `Span` with a `Context` to produce a new `Context`. These exist because
API users **SHOULD NOT** have direct access to the Context Key the tracing API uses internally.

If the language supports **implicit** context propagation, the API **SHOULD** additionally provide:
getting the currently-active span (equivalent to get-implicit-context-then-extract-span), and
setting the active span (equivalent to combine-then-make-implicit). These may be exposed as static
module-level functions and **SHOULD** be fully implemented at the API layer where possible.

---

## 8. Behavior of the API without an installed SDK

**Stability: Stable.**
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#behavior-of-the-api-in-the-absence-of-an-installed-sdk

"In general, in the absence of an installed SDK, the Trace API is a no-op API" — operations on a
`Tracer` or `Span` have no side effects. The one carve-out is `SpanContext` propagation continuity:
the API **MUST** return a non-recording `Span` wrapping whatever `SpanContext` was in the parent
`Context` (explicit or current-implicit). If that parent context's span is already non-recording,
it **SHOULD** be returned directly (no new object). If the parent context has no span at all, an
**empty** non-recording span **MUST** be returned — all-zero `SpanContext`, empty `TraceState`,
unsampled flags. Net effect: a `SpanContext` supplied by a configured `Propagator` still flows
through to children and eventually `Inject`, but no _new_ `SpanContext` gets created without an SDK.

---

## 9. Concurrency requirements (API)

**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#concurrency-requirements

- **TracerProvider / Tracer / Span** — all methods **MUST** be documented safe for concurrent use
  by default.
- **Event** — immutable, **MUST** be safe for concurrent use by default.
- **Link** — immutable, **SHOULD** be safe for concurrent use by default.

---

## 10. SDK: TracerProvider / Tracer (SDK)

**Stability: mixed.** Core `TracerProvider` responsibilities (owning config, `Shutdown`,
`ForceFlush`) are **Stable**; per-tracer dynamic enable/disable via `TracerConfigurator` /
`TracerConfig` is explicitly **Development**.
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/#tracer-provider

The SDK's `TracerProvider` **MUST** implement the API's Get-a-Tracer operation and **MUST** build
the `InstrumentationScope` from the caller-supplied name/version/schema_url/attributes, storing it
on the returned `Tracer`. Configuration ownership — `SpanProcessor`s, `IdGenerator`, `SpanLimits`,
`Sampler`, and (Development) `TracerConfigurator` — belongs to the `TracerProvider`; it MAY be
applied at construction time and the provider MAY expose update methods, but any update **MUST**
retroactively apply to already-returned `Tracer`s (implementations typically achieve this by having
`Tracer`s hold a reference back to the provider rather than caching config directly).

**Shutdown** — MUST be called only once per `TracerProvider`; subsequent `GetTracer` calls after
Shutdown are disallowed (SDKs **SHOULD** return a working no-op `Tracer` if possible instead of
erroring). **MUST** be implemented by invoking `Shutdown` on all internal processors. **SHOULD**
report success/failure/timeout to the caller and **SHOULD** complete or abort within some timeout
(sync or async, implementation's choice).

**ForceFlush** — immediately exports all not-yet-exported spans across all internal processors.
**MUST** invoke `ForceFlush` on every registered `SpanProcessor`. Same SHOULD-report-outcome /
SHOULD-timeout guidance as Shutdown.

**`TracerConfigurator` (Development):** a function `tracer_scope -> TracerConfig` (or a
"use-default" sentinel) that the `TracerProvider` calls per-`Tracer`, both at first creation and
(if updating is supported) for every outstanding `Tracer` when the configurator itself is updated —
so it "is important that it returns quickly." Modeled as a function for flexibility; SDKs MAY offer
shorthand helpers (select tracers by name/pattern, disable specific tracers, disable-all-then-allow­list).

**`TracerConfig` (Development):** currently one field, `enabled` (default `true`). A disabled
`Tracer` **MUST** behave like the API's no-op/no-SDK `Tracer`. `enabled` directly determines
`Enabled()`'s return value (`false` → `Enabled()` returns `false`; `true` → returns `true`).
Implementations don't need config changes to be _immediately_ visible to `Enabled()` callers, but
they **MUST** be eventually visible.

**`Enabled` (SDK semantics, Development flag inside a Stable-by-default method):** **MUST** return
`false` when there are no registered `SpanProcessor`s, or (Development) when
`TracerConfig.enabled == false`. Otherwise it **SHOULD** return `true`, and MAY return `false` for
other optimization reasons.

---

## 11. SDK: Additional span interfaces (readable / read-write span)

**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/#additional-span-interfaces

The API only defines write access to a `Span`; the SDK needs to read data back out for processors
and exporters, so it defines two SDK-internal contracts:

- **Readable span** — MUST expose everything added via the API-level `Span` interface (that spec
  section is authoritative for the full list), MUST expose `InstrumentationScope` (since 1.10.0)
  and `Resource`, MUST (for back-compat) also expose the deprecated `InstrumentationLibrary` view
  with matching name/version, MUST let callers reliably determine whether the span has ended, and
  MUST expose attribute/event/link **dropped counts** (for exporters, per the
  [non-OTLP mapping spec](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/common/mapping-to-non-otlp/#dropped-attributes-count)).
  Implementations MAY choose not to expose the full parent `Context`, but MUST expose at least the
  full parent `SpanContext`. May or may not be mutable.
- **Read/write span** — everything a readable span has, plus the full write API, and callers
  **MUST** be able to obtain the _same_ `Span` instance/type that span-creation returned to the user
  (e.g. passed as a parameter, or via a getter).

---

## 12. Sampling (SDK) {#sampling-sdk}

**Stability: mixed** — the core `Sampler`/`ShouldSample` contract, `AlwaysOn`/`AlwaysOff`, and
`TraceIdRatioBased`'s _configuration/creation_ surface are **Stable**; `ProbabilitySampler`,
`CompositeSampler`/`ComposableSampler` and the whole explicit-randomness / `Random`-flag apparatus
are **Development**; `TraceIdRatioBased`'s _algorithm compatibility_ note is separately flagged
**Development** even though the sampler itself is Stable.
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/#sampling

Sampling controls collection noise/overhead. Two API-level signals govern it:

- **`IsRecording`** on `Span` — if `false`, all data is discarded. `SpanProcessor`s **MUST** only
  receive spans with `IsRecording == true`; `SpanExporter`s **SHOULD NOT** receive them unless
  `Sampled` is _also_ set.
- **`Sampled`** flag in `TraceFlags` on `SpanContext` — propagates to children via `SpanContext`;
  indicates the span _has been_ sampled and will be exported. Exporters **MUST** receive spans with
  `Sampled == true` and **SHOULD NOT** receive ones without it.

### Recording × Sampled reaction table

| `IsRecording` | `Sampled` | Processor receives? | Exporter receives? |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| true          | true      | true                | true               |
| true          | false     | true                | false              |
| false         | true      | **Not allowed**     | **Not allowed**    |
| false         | false     | false               | false              |

`IsRecording=false, Sampled=true` is a forbidden combination: "the OpenTelemetry SDK MUST NOT allow
this combination" because it would create gaps in the distributed trace. `IsRecording=true,
Sampled=false` is legal and means "this span records data but its children likely won't."

> **Maple relevance:** a spec-compliant SDK will never emit the forbidden combination, but
> defensive ingest code should treat `Sampled=true` + missing/absent span data as a signal of a
> non-compliant producer or transport-layer data loss, not assume it can't happen.

### SDK span creation order

When creating a span, the SDK **MUST** act as if, in order: (1) use the parent's trace ID if valid,
else generate a new one — _before_ calling `ShouldSample`, which requires a valid trace ID as
input; (2) call the `Sampler`'s `ShouldSample`; (3) generate a new span ID regardless of the
sampling decision (so other components — logs, exception handling — can rely on a unique span ID
even for a non-recording span); (4) construct the span per the `ShouldSample` decision (a
non-recording result MAY reuse the same "wrap a SpanContext" mechanism as the no-SDK API path).

### Sampler interface

**`ShouldSample`** — required inputs: parent `Context` (its `SpanContext` may be invalid → root
span), the new span's `TraceId` (MUST match the parent's if parent has a valid trace ID), span
name, `SpanKind`, initial `Attributes`, and the collection of `Link`s. Returns a `SamplingResult`:

| `SamplingResult` field | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Decision`             | One of `DROP` / `RECORD_ONLY` / `RECORD_AND_SAMPLE` — see table below.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Attributes             | Additional span attributes to add; the returned object MUST be immutable.                                                                                                                                               |
| `Tracestate`           | The `TraceState` for the new `SpanContext`. If the sampler returns an _empty_ `Tracestate`, the existing one is cleared — so samplers that don't intend to change it SHOULD pass through the incoming value unmodified. |

| `Decision`          | `IsRecording`                                              | `Sampled` flag      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `DROP`              | `false` — span not recorded, all events/attributes dropped | not set             |
| `RECORD_ONLY`       | `true`                                                     | **MUST NOT** be set |
| `RECORD_AND_SAMPLE` | `true`                                                     | **MUST** be set     |

**`GetDescription`** — returns the sampler's name/config as a debug string (e.g.
`"TraceIdRatioBased{0.000100}"`); MAY change over time (e.g. under dynamic reconfiguration);
callers **SHOULD NOT** cache it.

| `TraceIdRatioBased`                      | Stable (config/creation API); algorithm compatibility notes are Development | Deterministic hash of `TraceId` decides sampling; ignores parent `Sampled` flag (compose with `ParentBased` to respect it). A given ratio MUST sample a superset of what any lower-ratio instance would sample (monotonic — lets a backend sample at a higher rate than the frontend safely). **Deprecation note:** being phased out in favor of `ProbabilitySampler`; "OpenTelemetry SDK implementors SHALL NOT remove or modify the behavior of the original `TraceIdRatioBased` sampler until at least January 1, 2027," after which they're encouraged to silently swap in an equally-configured `ProbabilitySampler`. Exact hash algorithm was never specified — cross-SDK/cross-version results may differ, so it's recommended only as a _root_ sampler. |

### Sampling requirements — TraceID randomness (Development)

The [W3C Trace Context Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/) CR defines a `Random` trace
flag meaning "the rightmost 7 bytes / 56 bits of the TraceID are random." SDKs **SHOULD** set this
`Random` flag on root spans when they generate TraceIDs meeting that randomness bar. SDKs and
Samplers **MUST NOT** overwrite an explicit randomness value (the `rv` sub-key of OTel's
`tracestate`, see
[TraceState Handling](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/tracestate-handling/#explicit-randomness-value-rv))
once a user has set one; root samplers MAY insert an `rv` value themselves when the generated
TraceID doesn't meet the randomness bar and no `rv` is already present. Absent an explicit
randomness value, samplers **SHOULD** presume TraceIDs are W3C-Level-2-random. Custom
`IdGenerator`s **SHOULD** self-identify when all their generated TraceIDs meet the randomness bar so
the SDK can correctly set the `Random` flag.

## 13. Span Limits

**Stability: Stable** (attribute-limit portions are defined once, in the common spec, and inherited
here).
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/#span-limits

Span attributes **MUST** follow the common
[attribute-limits](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/common/#attribute-limits) rules. The
SDK MAY additionally discard links/events beyond a configured per-collection limit. If a limit is
implemented, the SDK **MUST** expose a way to change it via `TracerProvider` configuration.
Discarding an attribute/event/link due to a limit **SHOULD** log a message — but **MUST** be logged
**at most once per span** (not once per discarded item) to avoid log spam.

and the neighboring "Span limits" / "Attribute limits" tables on that same page.

**Attribute value types** (common spec, inherited by span attributes) — Source:
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/common/#attribute — attribute keys **MUST** be non-null,
non-empty strings; key casing is preserved and case-sensitive (differently-cased keys are distinct
keys). Attribute values **MUST** be one of the types defined by `AnyValue` (string, boolean,
double-precision float, signed 64-bit integer, byte array, homogeneous/nested arrays, maps, and
empty). Verified against the raw spec source (`specification/common/README.md` on `main`,
2026-07): "The attribute value MUST be one of types defined in AnyValue." _Note:_ earlier spec
versions restricted plain `Attribute` values to only primitives and homogeneous primitive arrays
(no maps/nesting); the current spec unifies `Attribute` with the broader `AnyValue` definition
used by log bodies. When validating third-party producers instrumented with older SDKs, expect
the stricter, pre-unification subset in practice.

## 14. ID Generators

**Stability: Stable** for the core requirement; **Development** for the self-identifying-randomness
extension.
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/#id-generators

"The SDK MUST by default randomly generate both the `TraceId` and the `SpanId`." The SDK **MUST**
provide a mechanism to customize ID generation for both (typically via an `IdGenerator`-style
interface exposing `generateSpanIdBytes()` / `generateTraceIdBytes()`). Vendor-specific ID
generators (e.g. AWS X-Ray's ID format) **MUST NOT** be maintained/distributed as part of
OpenTelemetry's own core packages.

**(Development)** Custom `IdGenerator`s **SHOULD** self-identify when _all_ generated TraceIDs meet
the W3C Trace Context Level 2 randomness bar, so the SDK can set the `Random` trace flag
accordingly — typically inferred statically via a marker interface rather than per-call.

## 15. Span Processor {#span-processor-sdk}

**Stability: Stable**, except `OnEnding` which is explicitly **Development**.
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/#span-processor

A `SpanProcessor` hooks span start/end. Processors are invoked **only** when `IsRecording` is true.
Built-in processors handle batching + conversion to an export-friendly representation before
handing off to exporters. Multiple processors register directly on the `TracerProvider` and run **in
registration order**; each forms the head of its own pipeline (processor + optional exporter), and
the SDK **MUST** allow each pipeline to end with an individual exporter. The SDK **MUST** allow
users to implement and register custom processors.

### Interface

The `SpanProcessor` interface **MUST** declare `OnStart`, `OnEnd`, `Shutdown`, `ForceFlush`, and
**SHOULD** declare `OnEnding`.

| Method                             | Timing / threading                                           | Contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OnStart(span, parentContext)`     | Synchronous, on the span-starting thread                     | MUST NOT block/throw. Multiple processors' `OnStart` run in registration order. `span` is a read/write span; keeping a reference and observing live updates SHOULD work (e.g. a processor that periodically inspects all active spans from a background thread). `parentContext` is the SDK-determined parent (explicit / current / empty, per what was requested). Returns void.                                                                                                                                             |
| `OnEnding(span)` — **Development** | Synchronous, inside `Span.End()`, _before_ `OnEnd`           | Called once the end timestamp is computed (its own duration is excluded from span duration) but while the span is **still mutable** (`SetAttribute`/`AddLink`/`AddEvent` still legal). MUST NOT block/throw. Multiple processors' `OnEnding` run in registration order; the SDK MUST guarantee no other thread can modify the span once the first `OnEnding` starts — only synchronous in-callback modification is allowed from that point. **All** registered `OnEnding` callbacks run before **any** `OnEnd` callback runs. |
| `OnEnd(span)`                      | Synchronous, inside `Span.End()`, after end timestamp is set | MUST NOT block/throw. `span` is a readable span; even if technically mutable, modifying it here is not allowed (already ended).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Shutdown()`                       | —                                                            | SHOULD be called only once; subsequent `OnStart`/`OnEnd`/`ForceFlush` calls SHOULD be gracefully ignored. MUST include the effects of `ForceFlush`. SHOULD report success/failure/timeout and SHOULD complete/abort within some timeout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `ForceFlush()`                     | —                                                            | Hint to complete any in-flight span work "as soon as possible, preferably before returning." If the processor has an exporter, it SHOULD `Export` everything not yet exported, then call the exporter's `ForceFlush` — built-in processors **MUST** do so. If a timeout is set, the processor MUST prioritize the timeout over completeness (may abort/skip calls). SHOULD report outcome; SHOULD only be called when "absolutely necessary" (e.g. FaaS suspend-after-invocation risk).                                       |

### Built-in processors

The standard SDK **MUST** implement both. (Other cross-cutting processing scenarios are steered
toward the out-of-process [Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/overview/#collector)
instead of more built-in processors.)

**Simple processor** — passes each finished span to the configured exporter immediately as it
finishes. MUST synchronize `Export` calls so they're never invoked concurrently. Configurable:
`exporter`.

**Batching processor** — batches finished spans before handing them to the exporter; also MUST
synchronize `Export` calls. Exports a batch when (previous export has returned AND) any of:
`scheduledDelayMillis` since construction / since first span in a new window, `scheduledDelayMillis`
since previous export timer ended/completed, the queue reaches `maxExportBatchSize`, or
`ForceFlush()` is called. An empty queue at export time MAY export an empty batch or skip export
entirely (implementation's choice).

### Concurrency

`Span processor` — all methods **MUST** be safe for concurrent calls.

## 16. Span Exporter

**Stability: Stable.**
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/#span-exporter

The `SpanExporter` interface is what protocol-specific exporters implement to plug into the SDK; it
minimizes exporter implementation burden — an exporter is meant to be "primarily a simple telemetry
data encoder and transmitter." Each implementation **MUST** document its own concurrency
requirements.

**Interface:** MUST support `Export`, `Shutdown`, `ForceFlush` (typically one interface per signal,
e.g. `SpanExporter`).

| Method          | Contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Export(batch)` | Exports a batch of readable spans (serialize + transmit, typically). "should not be called concurrently with other Export calls for the same exporter instance" — but the underlying transmission work MAY still happen concurrently under the hood (language-specific). **MUST NOT block indefinitely** — must time out with `Failure` after a reasonable upper limit. Retry logic is the **exporter's** responsibility, not the built-in processors' — "The default SDK's Span Processors SHOULD NOT implement retry logic" since it's protocol/backend-specific (e.g. [OTLP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/) defines its own send/retry logic). Returns an `ExportResult`: `Success` ("the batch has been successfully exported" — e.g. delivered over the wire) or `Failure` ("exporting failed. The batch must be dropped," e.g. unserializable data). |
| `Shutdown()`    | Opportunity for exporter cleanup; called on SDK shutdown. Should be called only once; after it, subsequent `Export` calls are disallowed and **should return `Failure`**. Should not block indefinitely even if flushing to an unavailable destination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `ForceFlush()`  | Hint that any spans already received prior to the call should be exported "as soon as possible, preferably before returning." SHOULD report success/failure/timeout; SHOULD only be called when "absolutely necessary" (same FaaS-suspend rationale as the processor's `ForceFlush`); SHOULD complete/abort within some timeout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Concurrency:** `ForceFlush` and `Shutdown` **MUST** be safe to call concurrently on a `SpanExporter`.

## 18. Self-observability (SDK)

**Stability: Development.**
**Source:** https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/#self-observability

"The Tracing SDK SHOULD support
[SDK self-observability](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/self-observability/)" — i.e. the
SDK itself emitting metrics/logs about its own internal health (queue depth, export failures,
etc.), distinct from the application's own OTel-instrumented telemetry. This is the spec-level
counterpart to what Maple's own `apps/ingest` does manually today (its `PeriodicReader`-pushed
operational metrics — see CLAUDE.md "Self-Observability" — mirror the shape this section describes
for SDKs generally).
