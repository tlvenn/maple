/**
 * Consent gating for session capture.
 *
 * The posture, deliberately:
 *
 * - `requireConsent` defaults to **false**. Flipping that default would
 *   silently stop telemetry for every existing install — an availability
 *   incident dressed up as a privacy win. Apps that need a consent gate opt in.
 * - Global Privacy Control **is** honored by default, but only against the
 *   persistent visitor id, not the session itself. GPC is a legally recognized
 *   signal in several US states and it maps exactly onto the one cross-session
 *   identifier this SDK stores; the session-scoped capture that powers replay
 *   and error triage is unaffected.
 * - `doNotTrack` is **not** honored by default. It is deprecated, removed from
 *   Safari, and ignored across the industry, so respecting it would mostly mean
 *   dropping data from users who never intended to opt out. Apps can turn it on.
