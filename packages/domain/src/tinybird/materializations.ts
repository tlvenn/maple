// attribute) — a cross-span join that an *incremental* ClickHouse MV cannot
// express. The table is filled by the scheduled hourly rollup in
// `ServiceMapRollupService`, which runs that join once per completed hour.
//
// Why not a *refreshable* MV (`REFRESH EVERY 1 HOUR`), which can run a join?
//  - This schema deploys to both Tinybird and ClickHouse; Tinybird has no
//    refreshable-MV equivalent, so the rollup (routed via WarehouseQueryService)
//    is the only mechanism that works for both backends.
//  - Refreshable MVs are still experimental on the deployed ClickHouse (24.8).
//  - The job adds bounded-lookback catch-up + skip-existing idempotency that a
//    `REFRESH ... APPEND` MV does not provide.

/**
 * Materialized view populating error_events from traces where StatusCode='Error'.
 * Unwraps the first OTel `exception` event and computes a cityHash64
 * FingerprintHash used to group occurrences into Issues.
 *
 * Fingerprint inputs: (OrgId, ServiceName, ExceptionType, top-3 normalized frames, msg fallback).
 * - Stack lines are filtered to frame-shaped ones (must contain `:NUMBER`), which
 *   skips language-specific headers like Python's "Traceback..." or Java's
 *   "Exception: message" that would otherwise leak dynamic message text into the hash.
 * - Line numbers (`:123`) and hex pointers (`0x...`) are stripped so minor code
 *   moves don't rotate the fingerprint.
 * - Top 3 frames are hashed (not just 1) so errors raised inside shared library
 *   code still distinguish between different call sites.
 * - Whenever there are no frame-shaped stack lines, a normalized prefix of
 *   StatusMessage (IDs/numbers/hex runs redacted) is folded into the hash — even
 *   when ExceptionType is present. This prevents generic types (e.g.
 *   "HttpServerError", "Error") or malformed types (e.g. a stringified JSON
 *   prefix) from monopolizing a single bucket per service.
 *
 * DeploymentEnv is intentionally NOT part of the hash: the same bug across
 * staging/prod should stay one issue; filter by env at query/triage time.
 *
 * The normalization below is mirrored in `./fingerprint.ts` (TS) for unit tests
 * across Node/Python/Java/Go stack shapes. If you change one, change both.

 * datasource's sort key differs. Keep the fingerprint/label logic in ONE place so the
 * two tables can never diverge — see the long note above about mirroring `fingerprint.ts`.
