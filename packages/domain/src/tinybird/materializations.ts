 * - Stack lines are filtered to frame-shaped ones (must contain `:NUMBER`), which
 *   skips language-specific headers like Python's "Traceback..." or Java's
 *   "Exception: message" that would otherwise leak dynamic message text into the hash.
 * - Line numbers (`:123`) and hex pointers (`0x...`) are stripped so minor code
 *   moves don't rotate the fingerprint.
 * - Top 3 frames are hashed (not just 1) so errors raised inside shared library
 *   code still distinguish between different call sites.
 * - Whenever there are no frame-shaped stack lines, a normalized prefix of
 *   StatusMessage (IDs/numbers/hex runs redacted) is folded into the hash — even
 *   when ExceptionType is present. This prevents generic types (e.g.
 *   "HttpServerError", "Error") or malformed types (e.g. a stringified JSON
 *   prefix) from monopolizing a single bucket per service.
 *
 * DeploymentEnv is intentionally NOT part of the hash: the same bug across
 * staging/prod should stay one issue; filter by env at query/triage time.
 *
 * The normalization below is mirrored in `./fingerprint.ts` (TS) for unit tests
 * across Node/Python/Java/Go stack shapes. If you change one, change both.
