/**
 * The `AlertDestination` constructor must keep its discriminated union.
 *
 * Alchemy types props as `InputProps<Props>`, a mapped type that collapses a
 * union to the keys its members share — which erased every channel-specific
 * field and made the resource uncallable. The declared call signature restores
 * it; these compile-time assertions are how we notice if it regresses (a stale
 * `@ts-expect-error` fails as TS2578). Wire bodies are covered by contract.test.
