/**
 * Codec that lets the alert-`evaluate` path reuse the timeseries bucket cache
 * (`BucketCacheService`), which stores `TimeseriesPoint { bucket, series:
 * Record<string, number> }`.
 *
 * The bucket cache is built for the dashboard `execute` path, whose points only
 * carry an aggregated value per group. Alert evaluation additionally needs the
 * per-bucket **sample count** (to compute `GroupedAlertObservation.sampleCount`
 * and `hasData`) and must tolerate `null` values (a bucket with no data).
 *
 * `series` is `Record<string, number>` — it can hold neither a second number
 * per group nor `null`. So we encode, per group key `G`:
 *   - `CNT_PREFIX + G` -> sampleCount   (always written, even when 0)
 *   - `VAL_PREFIX + G` -> value         (written ONLY when finite; absence = null)
 *
 * The prefixes are NUL-delimited so they can never collide with a real group
 * key (service names, attribute values, `"all"`, or `" · "`-joined
 * composites never start with a NUL byte). These encoded points are produced
 * AND consumed only by the evaluate path (isolated from execute points by a
 * discriminated cache fingerprint), so the encoding never leaks into dashboard
 * rendering.
