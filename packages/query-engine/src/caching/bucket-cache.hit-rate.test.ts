/**

 * warehouse?" — which stays true even when the real access pattern produces a
 * 5% hit rate, because dashboards never issue the same request twice. These
 * tests drive *sequences* that model how a dashboard actually queries (a window
 * that slides, a user who zooms and pans, several widgets firing at once) and
 * assert on the aggregate: what fraction of requested buckets came from cache,
 * and how many warehouse queries that cost.
 *
 * Every scenario asserts two things, and both matter. Coverage alone would pass
 * for a cache that returns confident garbage, so each scenario also compares its
 * points against an uncached oracle run of the identical sequence — a wrong hit
 * is worse than a miss.
