/**
 * The page-level metadata session, handed out as reference-counted leases.
 *
 * The refcount is load-bearing, not defensive scaffolding: `Maple.layer` starts
 * a client session per *runtime*, and two runtimes can overlap on one page —
 * `ManagedRuntime.dispose()` resolves asynchronously, so a React StrictMode
 * double-mount (or an HMR remount) builds the replacement runtime before the
 * outgoing one's release finalizer runs. Both then hold a lease on the same
 * singleton. Without the count, the outgoing runtime's `shutdown` posts the
 * `ended` row and clears `current` while the live runtime is still holding the
 * handle — the session dies mid-page and nothing restarts it, because
 * `setupStandaloneSession` only runs on runtime start. Two `MapleFlush.make()`
 * calls in one page reproduce the same overlap.
 *
 * Within a single `startClientSession` controller leases never overlap
 * (`stopRuntime` calls the outgoing `shutdown` synchronously, before any await,
 * and `startRuntime` refuses to run while a runtime exists), so the count only
 * ever exceeds 1 across controllers. The per-lease `released` flag keeps a
 * double `shutdown` of one lease from decrementing twice and stranding another
 * holder. Covered by the overlap cases in `standalone-session.test.ts`.
