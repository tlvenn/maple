	 *
	 * So a revoke ends metrics for the life of the page. This is the same trade
	 * the OTLP preset makes by suppressing `/v1/metrics` outright under
	 * `requireConsent` (`consent-http-client.ts`); spans and logs, whose buffers
	 * *can* be dropped, resume normally after a re-grant. Gating on `captured`
