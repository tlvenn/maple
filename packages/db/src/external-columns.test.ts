/**
 * Columns consumed by an external, read-only system.
 *
 * That system reads this database directly and lives outside this repository,
 * so a rename or drop here is invisible to it until it breaks at runtime — and
 * because it reads on a background schedule, the failure surfaces long after
 * the deploy that caused it. This test is the only mechanism that catches such
 * a change *in the PR that makes it*.
 *
 * If a change here is intentional, update this list in the same PR and treat it
 * as a coordinated change: the consumer has to ship its side first. Adding a
 * column is always safe; renaming, dropping, or changing the type of one listed
 * below is not.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow — only columns actually read. Do not add a table
 * here "for completeness"; every entry is a constraint on future migrations.
