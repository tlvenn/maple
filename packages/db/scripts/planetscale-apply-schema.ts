 * Mints an ephemeral credential for the branch (direct port 5432 — DDL must NOT
 * go through the PSBouncer/Hyperdrive poolers), runs `drizzle-kit migrate`, then
 * revokes the credential. Idempotent: drizzle skips migrations already recorded
 * in `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`, so re-running is a no-op on an up-to-date
 * branch.
