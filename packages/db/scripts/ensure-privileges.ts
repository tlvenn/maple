/**
 * Make a PlanetScale Postgres branch grant correct privileges to new tables BY
 * ITSELF, so a plain `drizzle-kit migrate` can never again ship a table the
 * fleet cannot read.
 *
 * Run this BEFORE migrate (order matters — `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` only
 * applies to objects created after it):
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL="$MAPLE_PG_URL" bun packages/db/scripts/ensure-privileges.ts
 *
 * `ps:apply-schema` calls `ensureRuntimePrivileges` directly, so the prod path
 * needs no separate invocation.
 *
 * ── Why PUBLIC, and why no runtime-role name ──────────────────────────────
 * Prod has four `pscale_api_*` login roles. Three are members of `postgres`
 * with rolinherit and so can read a postgres-owned table through inheritance;
 * `pscale_api_rg068pnctlxw` — the ingest gateway, which connects via PSBouncer
 * on 6432 rather than Hyperdrive — is NOT a member and reads only through
 * PUBLIC. That asymmetry is the whole shape of the 2026-07-29 outage: a new
 * table with owner-only privileges broke the gateway alone while the API and
 * alerting workers kept serving, so it hid for 21.7h.
 *
 * PUBLIC covers every consumer without naming any of them, which is what lets
 * this run with no configuration. The old approach needed MAPLE_PG_RUNTIME_ROLE
 * naming one specific role, and granting that role was never what kept the
 * fleet up.
 *
 * ── Why default privileges rather than a post-migrate grant sweep ─────────
 * A sweep has to be remembered on every path that ever runs DDL. Default
 * privileges are a property of the branch: once set, every subsequent
 * `CREATE TABLE` is born correct, including tables created by a rebuild
 * migration that DROPped its grants. The sweep below is kept only to heal
 * objects that predate this — it is idempotent and cheap.
 *
 * Default privileges are keyed to the CREATING role, so this pins the session to
 * `postgres` first (see `pinSessionRoleToPostgres` in planetscale-connection.ts,
 * which does the same for the brokered prod connection). Where that is not
 * permitted we fall back to keying them to the session's own role, which is
 * correct for stg / PR previews — there the migrate role and the runtime role
 * are the same identity.
