/**
 * DORMANT since 2026-08 — PR previews no longer provision a PlanetScale branch
 * (see `resolveDatabaseMode` in packages/infra/src/cloudflare/stage.ts). Kept
 * intact as the reverse path; nothing calls it while `pr` maps to `"none"`.
 *
 * In-place SQL reset of a PlanetScale PR-preview branch — the fast path of
 * `scripts/planetscale-pr-branch.ts up`.
 *
 * A PS-DEV Postgres branch takes ~9 minutes to provision, so the preview deploy
 * no longer deletes + recreates `pr-<n>` on every push. Instead the branch
 * lives for the PR's lifetime and each deploy resets it to empty here, which
 * takes seconds. The reset must leave the database indistinguishable from a
 * fresh branch as far as `drizzle-kit migrate` is concerned:
 *
 *   1. `DROP SCHEMA drizzle` — the migrations journal, so migrate replays from
 *      0000 onto the empty DB.
 *   2. Drop every object INSIDE `public` (tables, views, sequences, routines,
 *      enums/domains) — but never `public` itself: it is owned by
 *      `pg_database_owner`, which cannot be granted, so `DROP SCHEMA public`
 *      is not reliably ours to run. Per-object drops only need the object
 *      owners, which we assume below.
 *   3. `DROP PUBLICATION` (all) — publications are database-level, so they
 *      survive the schema drops with an emptied table list. Left in place,
 *      0009_electric_publication's replayed `CREATE PUBLICATION` would hit
 *      duplicate_object and its DO/EXCEPTION guard would roll back the whole
 *      block, leaving an empty publication and no REPLICA IDENTITY FULL.
 *   4. Drop *inactive* replication slots — Electric's old slot holds WAL once
 *      its source is gone; on a long-lived branch that would pin WAL forever.
 *      (The slot of the still-attached previous Electric source is `active`
 *      at this point — its environment is torn down by electric-pr-branch.ts
 *      later in the same deploy — so it gets swept on the NEXT deploy.)
 *
 * Ownership: the previous deploy hands everything it created to `postgres`
 * before finishing (packages/db/scripts/normalize-preview-ownership.ts after
 * migrate; scripts/electric-pr-branch.ts for the Electric cloud publication),
 * and every pscale role inherits `postgres` — so this run's role owns the
 * prior run's objects through that membership and the drops below just work.
 * The `GRANT <owner> TO CURRENT_USER` loop that follows is a legacy
 * best-effort fallback for branches provisioned before normalization existed;
 * expect it to fail on PlanetScale (pscale_api_* roles are not grantable —
 * "permission denied to grant role", run 30051727304) — the drops that follow
 * are the real test, and their failure pushes the caller onto the
 * delete → recreate fallback.
 *
 * Exits non-zero if the reset cannot be completed; the caller falls back to
 * the slow delete + recreate path, so failure here costs time, not correctness.
 *
 * Usage:  DATABASE_URL="$MAPLE_PG_URL" bun run --cwd packages/db db:reset-preview
