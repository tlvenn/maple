/**
 * Per-PR PlanetScale Postgres branch lifecycle for the PR-preview deploy.
 * Sibling of scripts/tinybird-pr-branch.ts with the same up/down contract.
 *
 * ⚠️ `up`/`down` are DORMANT since 2026-08: PR previews deploy with no
 * application database (`resolveDatabaseMode` → "none" for `pr`, see
 * packages/infra/src/cloudflare/stage.ts), so the deploy workflow no longer
 * calls them. Only `sweep` still runs on a schedule, as a residual safety net.
 * Restoring per-PR databases means flipping that resolver and re-adding the
 * steps described in the comment in .github/workflows/deploy-pr-preview.yml.
 *
 *   bun scripts/planetscale-pr-branch.ts up    <pr-number>
 *   bun scripts/planetscale-pr-branch.ts down  <pr-number>
 *   bun scripts/planetscale-pr-branch.ts sweep
 *
 * `up` ensures an ephemeral PlanetScale branch `pr-<n>` exists and is EMPTY,
 * mints a branch credential, and exports `MAPLE_PG_URL` (one connection string,
 * direct 5432) to $GITHUB_ENV — alchemy.run.ts parses it into the pr Hyperdrive
 * origin, and the `drizzle-kit migrate` workflow step uses it as-is.
 *
 * Provisioning a PS-DEV Postgres branch takes ~9 minutes, so `up` only CREATES
 * the branch on the PR's first deploy. Subsequent deploys reuse the branch and
 * reset it in SQL (packages/db scripts/reset-preview-branch.ts — drops the
 * drizzle + public schemas, publications, and stale replication slots), which
 * takes seconds and leaves migrate replaying onto an effectively fresh DB. If
 * that reset fails for any reason we fall back to the old delete → recreate
 * path, so it can only cost time, never correctness.
 *
 * `pscale branch create --wait` enforces its OWN ~10-minute cap and exits
 * non-zero with "branch creation timed out" while the branch keeps provisioning
 * server-side — so a create timeout is treated as non-fatal and we keep polling
 * `branch show` ourselves.
 *
 * `down` deletes the branch (called on PR close, after `alchemy:destroy:pr`,
 * which removes the Hyperdrive config). Branch deletion also revokes its
 * credentials. PS-DEV branches bill for time used, so `down` on close is
 * mandatory.
 *
 * `sweep` deletes every `pr-<n>` branch whose PR is already closed. The
 * close-event teardown is best-effort only — GitHub silently creates NO
 * `pull_request: closed` run for a PR that conflicts with its base (so stale
 * PRs closed without merging never tear down), and close runs on old branches
 * execute the branch's own (possibly pre-fix) workflow version. The scheduled
 * cleanup-preview-orphans workflow runs `sweep` as the safety net for
 * everything the event-driven path misses.
 *
 * `up` additionally refuses to provision when the PR is already closed (when a
 * GitHub token is available to check) — a delayed/re-run deploy landing after
 * the close-event teardown would otherwise silently recreate the branch with
 * nothing left to ever delete it.
 *
 * Auth: PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN_ID / PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN (the pscale
 * CLI reads both from the environment) + PLANETSCALE_ORG. The database name
 * comes from PLANETSCALE_DATABASE (default "maple").
