/**
 * Sweep orphaned per-PR Cloudflare Workers.
 *
 *   bun scripts/cloudflare-worker-orphan-sweep.ts
 *
 * PR-preview stages deploy every app as `maple-<base>-pr-<n>`
 * (packages/infra/src/cloudflare/stage.ts, resolveWorkerName). `alchemy
 * destroy --stage pr-<n>` deletes them on PR close — but the close-event
 * teardown is best-effort (see cleanup-preview-orphans.yml), so workers leak.
 *
 * Leaked workers are not just clutter: `maple-alerting-pr-<n>` workers keep
 * their cron triggers, and workers deployed from branches predating the
 * non-prod cron gate (#239, 2026-07-21) run the ticks unconditionally. They
 * ran silently against their own preview resources for months — until the
 * sibling sweeps (correctly) deleted those resources, after which every tick
 * failed with "Hyperdrive config deleted." into self-observability as
 * service.name="alerting", masquerading as a production alerting outage
 * (observed 2026-07-27..29).
 *
 * Worker ↔ queue deletion is mutually deadlocked: a Worker that is a
 * registered queue CONSUMER cannot be deleted (error 10064, NOT covered by
 * ?force=true — run 30406588392, and why the original close-event teardowns
 * wedged), and a queue referenced by a Worker's producer BINDING cannot be
 * deleted either (error 11005 — run 30407693847). Each preview api worker
 * both binds and consumes its stage's `maple-vcs-sync-pr-<n>` /
 * `maple-planetscale-webhooks-pr-<n>` queues (apps/api/alchemy.run.ts), so
 * the sweep breaks the cycle in three passes:
 *   1. detach the consumer registrations of closed-PR queues,
 *   2. delete the workers (their producer bindings die with them),
 *   3. delete the now-unreferenced queues.
 *
 * Deletion is double-gated like the sibling sweeps: the queue/worker name must
 * match `maple-<base>-pr-<digits>` exactly, where <base> may not contain
 * `-dev-` (prd `maple-api`, stg `maple-api-stg` can never match; a dev stage
 * named "pr-3" would produce `maple-api-dev-pr-3`, hence the -dev- exclusion),
 * AND the GitHub API must affirmatively report that PR closed — unknown/open →
 * keep. Worker deletes use ?force=true because preview workers service-bind
 * each other and hold Workflows and Durable Objects; without force those
 * deletions 400. The sweep matches on the `maple-<base>-pr-<digits>` shape
 * rather than an app allowlist, so it still reaches previews of apps that no
 * longer exist in this repo (e.g. leftover `maple-chat-flue-pr-<n>` workers
 * from before chat moved into apps/api). Deleting a queue or worker out from
 * under a later alchemy
 * destroy of the same stage is fine: alchemy tolerates already-deleted
 * resources.
 *
 * Auth: CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN + CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID (the same credentials
 * the deploy workflow's alchemy steps use), GITHUB_REPOSITORY +
 * GITHUB_TOKEN/GH_TOKEN for the PR-state gate.
