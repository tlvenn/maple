/**
 * Per-PR Electric Cloud environment lifecycle for the PR-preview deploy.
 * Sibling of scripts/planetscale-pr-branch.ts and scripts/tinybird-pr-branch.ts
 * with the same up/down contract.
 *
 *   bun scripts/electric-pr-branch.ts up    <pr-number>
 *   bun scripts/electric-pr-branch.ts down  <pr-number>
 *   bun scripts/electric-pr-branch.ts sweep
 *
 * `up` ensures an Electric Cloud **environment** for this PR and (re)creates the
 * Postgres **service** (the sync "source") inside it, pointed at this PR's
 * PlanetScale branch. The environment is REUSED across deploys; only the
 * services are reset (deleted + recreated) each run — the service is what points
 * at the now-dropped tables/rotated creds after the PlanetScale in-place reset.
 * Environments are NOT delete+recreated because Electric soft-deletes them:
 * a deleted environment disappears from `environments list` immediately but its
 * name stays reserved (observed >13 min, possibly forever), so recreating
 * `pr-<n>` right after deleting it fails with "name already exists". If the
 * base name is stuck from an earlier delete, `up` falls back to a suffixed name
 * `pr-<n>-r<run-id>`; matching everywhere is by exact name OR `pr-<n>-` prefix.
 * It then exports `ELECTRIC_URL` / `ELECTRIC_SOURCE_ID` / `ELECTRIC_SECRET` to
 * $GITHUB_ENV so the subsequent `alchemy:deploy:pr` binds the standalone
 * apps/electric-sync worker to this source (see apps/electric-sync/alchemy.run.ts).
 *
 * `down` deletes every `pr-<n>`/`pr-<n>-*` environment (called on PR close,
 * after `alchemy:destroy:pr`), deleting its services first — Electric refuses
 * to delete an environment that still holds services (`--force` does not
 * cascade). Each source counts against the Electric plan's max-databases cap
 * and holds a PlanetScale replication slot, so `down` on close is mandatory.
 *
 * `sweep` deletes every `pr-<n>`/`pr-<n>-*` environment whose PR is already
 * closed. The close-event teardown is best-effort only (GitHub creates no
 * `closed` run for conflicted PRs; close runs execute the PR branch's own old
 * workflow version; post-close redeploys recreate resources) — the scheduled
 * cleanup-preview-orphans workflow runs `sweep` as the safety net, mirroring
 * scripts/planetscale-pr-branch.ts.
 *
 * Depends on the PlanetScale `up` step having exported MAPLE_PG_URL (the direct
 * 5432 connection string) and the `drizzle-kit migrate` step having applied
 * `0009_electric_publication` (creates `electric_publication_default`).
 *
 * Auth: the Electric CLI (`@electric-sql/cli`) reads ELECTRIC_API_TOKEN
 * (`sv_live_...`) from the environment. Config:
 *   ELECTRIC_API_TOKEN            CLI auth token (required; also the workflow gate)
 *   ELECTRIC_PROJECT_ID           parent project id for the per-PR environment (required)
 *   MAPLE_PG_ELECTRIC_URL         PR branch connection string via the replication-
 *                                 attribute role (preferred; minted by planetscale-pr-branch.ts)
 *   MAPLE_PG_URL                  fallback connection string (required on `up` if the above is unset)
 *   ELECTRIC_CLOUD_URL            Cloud shape API base to export as ELECTRIC_URL (default
 *                                 https://api.electric-sql.cloud); deliberately NOT the
 *                                 local-dev `ELECTRIC_URL` (docker), which would be wrong here
 *   ELECTRIC_REGION               source region (default us-east-1; CLI accepts
 *                                 us-east-1 | eu-west-1 | ca-west-1)
 *   ELECTRIC_MANUAL_TABLE_PUBLISHING
 *                                 "false"/"0" disables the `--manual-table-publishing` flag
 *                                 (default ON — Electric must never need to own the tables
 *                                 on PlanetScale). NOTE: Electric Cloud does NOT read
 *                                 `electric_publication_default`; each Cloud source creates
 *                                 its own publication (`cloud_electric_pub_svc_<name>`) and
 *                                 manual publishing means WE must add the synced tables to
 *                                 THAT publication. After the source activates, this script
 *                                 mirrors the table list from the migration-owned
 *                                 `electric_publication_default` (0009/0011/0014) into the
 *                                 Cloud source's publication.
 *   ELECTRIC_SERVICE_EXTRA_ARGS   extra space-separated flags for `services create postgres`
 *   ELECTRIC_CLI                  override the CLI invocation (default pins the interface
 *                                 this script was written against: `bunx @electric-sql/cli@0.0.10`)
 *
 * CLI interface notes (verified against @electric-sql/cli 0.0.10 — bump the pin
 * only after re-verifying these):
 *   - `--json` / `-q` are GLOBAL options (root command); subcommands read them from
 *     the root, and commander accepts them before or after the subcommand.
 *   - `--json` errors go to STDERR as {"error","message","exitCode"}; exit codes are
 *     1 generic, 2 auth, 3 not-found, 4 validation, 5 conflict.
 *   - `environments create --json` prints { environmentId } (NOT `id`).
 *   - `environments list --project <id> --json` prints { environments: [{ id, name, createdAt }] }.
 *   - `environments delete <id> --force` (--force mandatory: --json mode and
 *     token-auth non-interactive mode both refuse to prompt).
 *   - `services create postgres --environment <id> --database-url <url> --region <r>`
 *     supports --manual-table-publishing (no `--publication <name>` flag exists; the
 *     Cloud source generates its own publication named `cloud_electric_pub_svc_<name>`) and
 *     --wait (poll until active, 300s default). Its --json result carries
 *     { id, status, sourceSecret } — the service id IS the shape-API source_id.
 *   - `services get-secret <id> --json` prints { secret }.

/**
 * Mirror the synced-table list into Electric Cloud's per-service publication.
 *
 * With `--manual-table-publishing`, Electric Cloud does NOT read
 * `electric_publication_default` — each Cloud source creates its own publication
 * (`cloud_electric_pub_svc_<name>`) and refuses to add tables to it, so a shape
 * request for an unpublished table fails with `Database table "public.<t>" is
 * missing from the publication "cloud_electric_pub_svc_..." and the
 * ELECTRIC_MANUAL_TABLE_PUBLISHING setting prevents Electric from adding it`.
 * The drizzle migrations (0009/0011/0014) keep `electric_publication_default`
 * as the source of truth for which tables sync, so we copy its membership into
 * every cloud publication here.
 *
 * Ownership choreography (all of this is PlanetScale-shaped):
 *   - ALTER PUBLICATION ... ADD TABLE requires owning BOTH the publication and
 *     the table. The Electric role (the creds handed to `services create`) owns
 *     the cloud publication, but the tables are owned by the migrate-step role.
 *   - Replication roles cannot RECEIVE role grants on PlanetScale (the
 *     two-role-split gotcha), so `GRANT <table-owner> TO <electric role>` is a
 *     dead end (run 30050755374: still "must be owner of table actors").
 *   - Every pscale role inherits `postgres`, though. So the MAIN role (which
 *     owns the tables and is a member of `postgres`) reassigns the synced
 *     tables to `postgres` via ALTER TABLE ... OWNER TO — permitted because
 *     the target is a role it belongs to. From then on the Electric role owns
 *     the tables through its own `postgres` membership, and future ephemeral
 *     migrate roles can still run DDL on them the same way.
 *
 * Each statement runs client-side and logs its own error — server-side RAISE
 * NOTICE output is discarded by the client, which made the first attempt's
 * failure invisible. Identifiers go through quoteIdent(); everything is
 * idempotent (owner reassignment skips postgres-owned tables, the mirror only
 * adds missing tables).
